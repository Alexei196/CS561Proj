REVIEW Traumatic spinal cord injury: current concepts 
and treatment update Traumatismo raquimedular: conceitos atuais e atualizações terapêuticas Carolina Rouanet, Danyelle Reges, Eva Rocha, Vivian Gagliardi, Gisele Sampaio Silva Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects . million North Americans, 
with more than half occurring after trauma. In Brazil, few studies have evaluated the epidemiology of SCI with an estimated 
incidence of  to  per million per year. With the aging of 
the population, the incidence is expected to increase, mainly 
due to fall-related injuries. Direct lifetime costs can be as high 
as $.-$. million per patient, and the consequences for the 
patients and their families can be devastating,. Search strategy A PubMed search for articles published up to September 
 was performed using the terms “Spinal Cord Injury” [Mesh] 
and (“traumatic” [Title/Abstract]), which returned , articles. 
Additionally, the reference lists of the most recent guidelines on 
the management of spinal cord injury were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the article titles and abstracts. Articles 
with at least one abstract in English or Portuguese were searched. Pathophysiology The initial primary trauma causes mechanical injury to 
the spinal cord, a combination of compression, laceration, 
distraction or shearing. After the resulting damage to the 
microvasculature, progressive edema develops, ongoing ischemia worsens and a pro-apoptotic signaling is initiated. There 
is disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, influx of inflammatory cells, vasoactive peptides, and release of coagulation 
factors. These events promote thrombosis and spasm of the 
microvessels, leading to further hypoxia. An energetic crisis 
is installed, there is production of oxygen free radicals, and 
excitotoxicity and cytotoxic edema develop. With loss of the 
parenchymal volume, cystic cavities coalesce, generating a 
physical barrier to cell migration. Because of the distortion 
of the structural framework, regenerative attempts do not 
succeed. Proliferation of astrocytes and deposition of fibroblasts worsen the picture. The Rho-ROCK (rho-associated

Received  January ; Accepted  March . ABSTRACT Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects . million North Americans, with more than half occurring after trauma. In Brazil, few studies have evaluated 
the epidemiology of SCI with an estimated incidence of  to  per million per year. The final extent of the spinal cord damage results from primary and secondary mechanisms that start at the moment of the injury and go on for days, and even weeks, after the event. There is convincing 
evidence that hypotension contributes to secondary injury after acute SCI. Surgical decompression aims at relieving mechanical pressure on the microvascular circulation, therefore reducing hypoxia and ischemia. The role of methylprednisolone as a therapeutic option is still a matter of debate, however most guidelines do not recommend its regular use. Neuroprotective therapies aiming to reduce further injury have been studied 
and many others are underway. Neuroregenerative therapies are being extensively investigated, with cell based therapy being very promising. Keywords: spinal cord injuries; spinal cord compression; neurosurgery; spinal cord regeneration; celland tissue-based therapy. RESUMO O traumatismo raquimedular (TRM) afeta . milhão de norte americanos, sendo mais da metade secundário a trauma.No Brasil, pouco estudos 
avaliaram sistematicamente a epidemiologia do TRM, mas estima-se uma incidência de  a  por milhão por ano. A extensão final do dano 
medular é resultante de mecanismos primários e secundários, que começam no momento do evento e prosseguem por dias e até semanas 
seguintes. Há fortes evidências de que a hipotensão contribua para danos secundários pós TRM. A cirurgia descompressiva visa a aliviar a 
compressão mecânica sobre a microcirculação, assim reduzindo isquemia e hipóxia. O papel da metilprednisolona no tratamento de pacientes 
com TRM é controverso, não sendo recomandada pela maior parte das diretrizes atuais. Terapias neuroprotetoras visando a reduzir injúria 
adicional foram e vêm sendo estudadas. Terapias neurorregenerativas estão sob investigação ampla, sendo a terapia celular uma forte promessa. Palavras-chave: traumatismos da medula espinhal; compressão da medula espinal; neurocirurgia; regeneração da medula espinal;

Together, all those mechanisms contribute to the restriction 
of regeneration,. 
The final extent of spinal cord damage results from 
primary and secondary mechanisms that start at the 
moment of the injury and go on for days and even weeks. 
Neuroprotective agents attempt to avert specific secondary injuries and prevent neural damage, while neuroregenerative therapies act to promote axonal regrowth after the 
damage has occured. Neurological classification After initial general stabilization, it is important to perform a thorough neurological examination. The American 
Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standard for neurological 
and functional classification is the recommended preferred 
tool. It is important as a means of standardizing the initial 
and follow-up examinations, and also has a role in predicting 
the prognosis. The tool consists of two components, the sensitive and 
the motor. The sensitive component comprises the testing of 
a key point in each of the  dermatomes (from C to S-) 
on the right and left sides. Light touch and pinprick sensation 
are also tested. Each modality is separately scored on a threepoint scale, ranging from  (absent) to  (normal or intact). 
The motor examination encompasses testing of key 
muscle functions corresponding to ten paired myotomes 
(C-T and L-S). Voluntary external anal sphincter 
contraction should also be tested. The strength should be 
graded according to the Medical Research Council grading 
system, from  to . 
With that, the neurological level of injury is determined 
as the most caudal segment of the cord with intact sensation 
and antigravity muscle function strength (Figure ). 
The ASIA Impairment Scale should be determined, as follows: A = complete. No sensory or motor functions in sacral 
segments S-S. B = sensory incomplete. Sensory but not motor function 
is preserved below the neurological level of injury including 
S-S and no motor function is preserved more than three 
levels below the motor level on each side of the body. C = motor complete. Motor function is preserved below 
the neurological level, and more than half the muscles 
below the neurological level of injury have a  muscle grade 
less than . D = motor incomplete. Motor function is preserved below 
the neurological level, and at least half the muscles below the 
neurological level of injury have a muscle grade > . E = Normal. Sensation and motor functions are normal in 
all segments tested. As previously mentioned, the ASIA Impairment Scale 
score has a prognostic value. Eighty-five percent of ASIA 
A patients will not regain function. Of the % who will 
improve, only % will have useful motor function. More 
than half (%) ASIA B patients, and the vast majority (%) 
of ASIA C-D patients will regain function. MOTOR C elbow ﬂexors C wrist extensors C elbow extensors C ﬁnger ﬂexors T ﬁnger abductors Upper limb maximum

Any anal sensation? Yes/No Voluntary anal contraction? American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Standard Neurological classification of spinal cord injury. Steps of required 
motor and sensory examinations. Rouanet C et al. Traumatic spinal cord injury Imaging According to the last SCI guideline, trauma patients who 
have complaints of neck pain, spinal tenderness, symptoms 
or signs of a neurological deficit related to the spine, and 
patients who cannot be clearly assessed (the ones who are 
unconscious, uncooperative, incoherent or intoxicated) need 
a radiographic study of the spinal cord. 
The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study 
(NEXUS) protocol was designed as an attempt to identify those 
at low risk for cervical fracture/subluxation/dislocation. It 
consists of five criteria: no posterior midline cervical tenderness, no intoxication, normal mental status, no other painful 
injuries and no neurological deficits. Patients meeting all of 
these criteria are at low risk of cervical injury and imaging of 
the neck or the spinal cord can be waived. The NEXUS protocol has a sensitivity of % and a negative predictive value of 
.% for cervical spinal cord injuries. Another protocol addressing the same issue is the 
Canadian C-Spine Rule, which consists of three questions: 
the presence of a high-risk factor that mandates radiography 
(age >  years, dangerous mechanism of trauma, or paresthesias in extremities), the presence of low risk factors allowing safe assessment of the range of motion, and the ability to 
actively rotate the neck º to the left and right. The use of 
the Canadian C-Spine Rule protocol resulted in % sensitivity for cervical spinal injury with a .% specificity. The imaging modality of choice is computed tomography 
(CT). If it is not available, a three-view spine x-ray is recommended (anteroposterior, odontoid and lateral views), being 
supplemented later by a CT scan. Magnetic resonance imaging should be obtained, when 
feasible, in the first  hours after the trauma. It can detect 
lesions in % of the cases in which the CT is normal, and is 
particularly useful for ligamentous lesions. It is also a valuable 
tool to classify severity and predict outcome based on the presence of hemorrhage, extent of edema, and severity of the initial 
compression. Intraspinal hemorrhages (> cm long) as well as 
longitudinal T signal changes > cm, are associated with poor 
prognosis. A normal initial magnetic resonance image is usually associated with complete recovery. 
Airway management Respiratory complications are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the acute phase of the SCI, with incidence ranging from % to %. Reduced vital capacity, 
retention of secretions, and autonomic dysfunction all play 
a role. Up to two thirds of patients will have complications 
such as atelectasis, pneumonia, or respiratory failure that 
require mechanical ventilation. The injury level and the ASIA classification are the 
two most important predictors for the need of intubation. 
Virtually % of lesions above C require intubation (the 
phrenic nerve originates from C-C), which should be performed electively rather than as an emergency. It is important 
to avoid hyperextension, rotation, and other movements of 
the neck during intubation. When possible, awake, fiberoptic 
intubation is preferred. In-line stabilization without traction 
is an alternative when a fiber optic laryngoscope or bronchoscope is unavailable.  
In selected patients with complete cervical lesions or in 
those with incomplete or lower lesions, conservative management might be an option. In such cases, lung function 
should be monitored closely with vital capacity, maximum 
inspiratory pressure and carbon dioxide partial pressure levels. Those measures can predict the need for intubation. With regard to ventilator weaning, only % of patients 
with lesions above C are successfully extubated. Predictors 
of the need for tracheostomy are ASIA A lesions, extent of 
the lesion, smoking, and previous lung disease. Some studies 
advocate that early tracheostomy (within  days) in these 
patients leads to a shorter ICU stay and reduction in the 
length of time of mechanical ventilation. Cardiovascular management Hypotension after SCI is frequent. It may be due to hypovolemia in a context of polytrauma, or due to the direct cervical or thoracic spinal trauma itself, leading to neurogenic 
shock. Neurogenic shock results from the interruption of 
sympathetic tone due to disruption in supraspinal control, 
and an intact parasympathetic influence via the vagus nerve, 
leading to an imbalance in the autonomic control. There is, 
therefore, loss of peripheral vascular tone and bradycardia. 
Although the deleterious consequences of hypotension in 
SCI have not been assessed in a controlled prospective way, 
there is convincing evidence that hypotension contributes to 
secondary injury after acute SCI, reducing spinal cord flow 
and perfusion. Based on this, the current recommendation is 
to strictly avoid hypotension, and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at -mmHg for seven days after injury (level 
III evidence). In order to achieve that goal, the mainstay of 
treatment is intravenous fluid therapy (mainly with crystalloids) to maintain a euvolemic or slightly hypervolemic status, 
in association with vasopressors. It is important to have invasive blood pressure monitoring with an arterial line. 
The main predictors of poor cardiovascular function 
requiring resuscitation and support are high cervical and 
complete lesions. Cardiovascular instability may be transient and episodic, but can also be recurrent in the first 
– days after injury. The best vasoactive amine is still a matter of debate. 
The last guideline does not address this controversy. A systematic review tried to answer several questions regarding 
the use of vasopressors in acute SCI. However, it was inconclusive in determining which vasopressor is better, what the 
optimal therapy duration is and what the MAP level is below 
which one should initiate vasopressor support. 
The vasopressor selection may depend on the level of the 
SCI and on the patient’s hemodynamics. In cervical or high 
Arq Neuropsiquiatr ;():thoracic lesions with both hypotension and bradycardia, 
a drug with chronotropic and inotropic effects as well as vasoconstrictor properties might be required. Norepinephrine 
(or alternatively, dopamine) could be good options. For low 
thoracic lesions, where hypotension is usually the result of 
peripheral vasodilation, a pure vasopressor drug such as 
phenylephrine could be appropriate. 
Recently, some studies have addressed the frequency of 
side effects and rates of complications related to the use of 
vasoactive drugs in this population. A high rate of cardiogenic 
complications was found, with up to % of patients experiencing at least one of the following: tachycardia, bradycardia, 
elevated troponin, new onset atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, 
or eletrocardiogram ST changes consistent with ischemia. 
A higher rate of side effects with the use of dopamine compared to norepinephrine and phenylephrine was described, 
especially in the population older than – years,,. Recently, Altaf and collaborators compared the effects 
of norepinephrine versus dopamine on MAP, the intrathecal pressure (monitored with a lumbar intrathecal catheter) 
and spinal cord pressure perfusion (the difference between 
MAP and intrathecal pressure). The conclusion was that 
norepinephrine was able to maintain MAP with a lower 
intrathecal pressure and correspondingly higher spinal cord 
pressure perfusion. These findings have led to a non-inferiority trial design 
called the “Mean Arterial Blood Pressure Treatment for 
Acute Spinal Cord Injury”, comparing the avoidance of hypotension (MAP ≥ mmHg) versus the induction of hypertension (MAP ≥ mmHg), which is currently recruiting patients 
and is expected to be completed in . Decompressive Surgery Progressive edema and hemorrhage contribute to the 
ongoing mechanical pressure on the microvascular circulation. Surgical decompression aims to relieve this pressure, 
thereby reducing secondary hypoxia and ischemia. Indications for surgery include significant cord compression with progressive neurological impairment and a fracture 
not amenable to, or not responding to, close reduction, such 
as unstable vertebral fractures. The Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study 
was a prospective, observational study that compared 
patients who had undergone surgery before and after  
hours from injury. The first group was more than twice as 
likely to have a two grade ASIA Impairment Scale improvement and a similar complication rate compared to the 
group with late surgery. Those findings were confirmed in a prospective Canadian 
cohort study even after adjusting for preoperative status and 
neurological level. With that, the concept of “time is spine” has emerged, and 
the ongoing recommendation is surgical decompression in 
the first  hours. The SCI-POEM is a European multicenter study that is 
currently recruiting patients with the aim to compare decompression < hours versus >  hours until  days. The final 
report is planned to be published in the end of . Intravenous methylprednisolone Methyprednisolone (MP) is a synthetic corticosteroid 
that upregulates anti-inflammatory factors and decreases 
oxidative stress, enhancing endogenous cell survival in animal models of SCI. It reduces edema, prevents intracellular 
potassium depletion and inhibits lipid peroxidation. Since the s, clinical trials have been trying to demonstrate its benefits in humans. The National Spinal Cord Injury 
Study I, published in , examined mg bolus MP followed by the same dose daily for  days, compared to mg 
bolus and then daily. No difference in motor or sensitive neurological recovery was observed between groups, and wound 
infections were more prevalent in the high-dose group.  
The National Spinal Cord Injury Study II, published in 
, compared MP mg/kg intravenously followed by 
. mg/kg/h over  hours to naloxone and placebo. At one 
year, there was no significant difference in neurological function among the groups. A subanalysis found that the subset of patients who received the corticosteroid within eight 
hours had a modest improvement in motor recovery. Wound 
infections were more frequent among MP patients. The National Spinal Cord Injury Study III, published in 
, compared three treatment groups: MP for  hours, the 
same drug administered for  hours and tirilazad mesylate 
(a potent lipid peroxidation inhibitor). Patients were treated 
within eight hours of SCI. In a post hoc analysis, in patients 
treated between three to eight hours from trauma, the 
-hour regimen was associated with a greater motor, but 
not functional, recovery. In addition, the group with the longer duration had more severe sepsis and pneumonia. 
Recently, a meta-analysis and systematic review concluded that evidence from multiple randomized controlled 
trials and also from observational studies do not support 
methylprednisolone use in acute SCI since it has no long-term 
benefits. Besides, it increases gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
and has a trend to increase overall adverse events. The last consensus does not recommend MP for treatment of SCI. Neuroprotection Neuroprotective agents aiming to reduce secondary insults 
are potential key therapies in SCI. Multiple approaches have 
been studied, and many others are currently under investigation. Gangliosides are glycolipid molecules present in neuronal membranes. Laboratory studies have shown that they 
can enhance axonal regeneration, besides having a variety of 
neuroprotective effects, such as prevention of apoptosis and 
anti-excitotoxic activity. GM(Sygen) was suggested as a 
therapeutic option until the  guideline (although without 
Rouanet C et al. Traumatic spinal cord injury demonstrated clinical benefit). However, a randomized 
controlled trial of the ganglioside compound reported no difference in neurological recovery after six months, therefore, 
it is no longer recommended,. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, was tested in the National 
Spinal Cord Injury Study II trial together with MP and placebo. The study was negative, with no differences in motor 
scores between groups. Nimodipine is an L-type calcium channel blocker thought 
to prevent calciumdependent apoptotic enzymes and block 
presynaptic release of glutamate. In comparison with placebo, however, no difference in neurological status at one 
year was noted. Tirilazad mesylate, a drug that attenuates peroxidation of 
neuronal membranes, was analyzed together with MP in the 
National Spinal Cord Injury Study III trial, with no difference 
between groups. There are no placebo-controlled studies. In animal studies, hypothermia decreased basal metabolic rate in the central nervous system, reduced inflammation, apoptosis, excitotoxicity, edema, gliosis, and increased 
angiogenesis. As well, traumatic SCI models showed 
improvement with the decreased temperature. A small pilot 
study in humans with SCI exposed to hypothermia showed a 
trend towards neurological recovery (% vs %) and no difference in complication rates. Another study evaluated  
ASIA A patients who were treated with hypothermia (ºC) 
for  hours, starting in the first six hours post-injury. Four 
patients converted to ASIA B in the first  hours. In the 
remaining patients, .% showed an improvement of at 
least one grade on the ASIA scale at the latest follow-up. 
These promising results led to a phase II/III trial named 
“The Acute Rapid Cooling Therapy for Injuries of the Spinal 
Cord”. This study (which is not yet recruiting) plans to evaluate different durations of hypothermia, starting within six 
hours post-trauma. Riluzole, a sodium-channel blocker, reduces secondary injury by blocking pathological activation of sodium 
channels and reducing the release of glutamate in preclinical models of SCI. A phase I/II trial demonstrated a benefit 
in motor scores in patients treated with the drug. A phase 
II/III trial, the Riluzole in Spinal Cord Injury Study, is ongoing, to evaluate the aforementioned drug in cervical lesions. 
It will be completed in . Minocycline is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory 
properties including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor 
alpha, interleukin  beta, cyclooxygenaseand nitric oxide 
synthase. In pre-clinical models, it decreased lesions sizes 
and neuron loss. In a phase II study, the ASIA motor score 
improved in patients treated with minocycline (p = .). 
This led to a phase III trial, the Minocycline in Acute Spinal 
Cord Injury, which is currently recruiting patients until . 
*Paralysis TMPtC: Neuroprotection: therapeutic hypothermia; . Assessed August . Fibroblast growth factor has been shown to protect 
against excitotoxicity and to reduce free radical production 
in animal models of SCI. A fibroblast growth factor analogue 
called SUN  was evaluated in a phase I/II trial completed in , but results are still pending. Cytokine granulocyte colony stimulating factor is neuroprotective in SCI by promoting cell survival and inhibiting tumor 
necrosis factor alpha and interleukin  beta. There were two 
small, non-randomized studies that demonstrated improvements in ASIA motor scores with the drug use,. 
Neuroregeneration A wide number of strategies are being developed worldwide to help recovery in SCI patients. There are numerous 
targets and therapeutic opportunities using endogenous and 
exogenous repair mechanisms. The aim is to surpass barriers 
to recovery such as the loss of structural framework, cystic 
cavitation, scarring and inhibitory molecular signaling. Cell-based therapies are promising modalities of regeneration. A wide number of cell types have been studied or are 
being evaluated in ongoing studies – embryonic stem cells, 
induced pluripotent stem cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, 
Schwann cells, mesenchymal cells, and activated autologous 
macrophages. In preclinical studies, cellular transplantation 
alone, or in combination with other therapies, was associated with neurological recovery, without any subtype showing superiority over the other. Small human studies also disclosed some degree of improvement, with no major adverse 
events. However, it is important to notice that, independent 
of treatment, most patients will undergo some spontaneous 
recovery in the first six months after injury. Therefore, confounding factors cannot be excluded from these results. Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells are 
capable of remyelinate axons, modulate the inflammatory 
response, regenerate lost neural circuits and modify the 
microenvironment. Schwann cells are able to remyelinate 
central nervous system axons and, in animal models, have 
reduced cystic cavitation, enhanced tissue sparing and 
enhanced recovery. Olfactory ensheathing cells are phagocytes capable of clearing microbes and debris and also of 
secreting neurotropic factors. In animals, they enhanced 
axonal regeneration and remyelination and also improved 
outcomes. Mesenchymal cells can differentiate along their 
connective tissue lineages and modulate inflammatory 
response at systemic and local environment levels. They 
have been shown to decrease inflammatory cell infiltration, increase pro-survival trophic factor levels and promote tissue sparing,. 
It should be noted that cellular transplantation remains 
an investigational and experimental therapy, with no formal 
recommendations.  
Arq Neuropsiquiatr ;():FINAL REMARKS Spinal cord injury management has substantially changed 
over the last years. Key early interventions are increasingly being recognized, as well as the need to better study 
these patients. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative 
strategies are probably more effective when done together, 
and they are an extensive field of current and future 
research. The pending trial results can have a significant 
impact on the standard of care, given that even small 
motor or sensory improvements can have profound effects 
on patients’ lives.

BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES SPINE INJURY INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION 
Fractures of the spinal column represent a small 
proportion of all fractures from traumatic injury 
with an incidence ranging from  to  percent., 
However, their impact on the individual and the 
health care system is significant because of their 
potential for long-term disability, the associated 
health care consequences, and costs. Despite 
improvements in the understanding of basic spinal 
fracture patterns, more reliable classification, and 
injury severity assessment systems, controversy 
remains in the management of these injuries. The 
threat of irreversible neural tissue injury and the 
presence of multiple traumatic injuries that may 
include life-threatening abdominal and thoracic 
injuries leads to complex decision making. Timing 
of surgical care for spinal injuries depends not only 
upon early decompression to improve or prevent 
further neurologic injury, but also on the need to 
first stabilize the patient’s hemodynamics or treat 
other life-threatening injuries. Operative versus 
nonoperative spinal column management is not 
always a clear decision, such as when progressive 
deformity or secondary neurologic deterioration is 
unlikely or it is unclear that surgical stabilization 
will contribute to an improved quality of life. 
Globally, the aging population is increasing and 
with it is the incidence of traumatic spinal injuries. 
The aging spine becomes increasingly vulnerable 
to injury as it stiffens and becomes osteoporotic. 
Comorbidities and frailty present management and 
outcome challenges. This publication is intended to provide an 
evidence-based, practical guide for the evaluation 
and management of an adult patient with a spinal 
injury, including both spinal column fracture (SCF) 
and spinal cord injury (SCI). When evidence is 
poor or absent, best practices are then based upon 
INTRODUCTION expert opinion which has been drawn from leaders 
in the fields of neurosurgery and orthopaedic 
surgery. 
This Best Practices Guideline (BPG) begins with 
the epidemiology of spinal injury, then reviews 
pre-hospital spinal motion restriction, cervical 
collar clearance, and appropriate imaging. It goes 
on to include details about completing a physical 
exam for evaluation of spinal cord injury and the 
classification systems for both spinal column 
injury and spinal cord injury. The indications for 
nonoperative and operative management are 
discussed for both blunt and penetrating spinal 
injuries. The use of mean arterial pressure (MAP)directed therapy is considered along with the 
limitations of its supporting data. Specific areas 
of management that are targeted include venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, neurogenic 
and spinal shock, SCI-induced bradycardia, 
ventilator management in a patient with high SCI, 
and analgesia. Because patients with SCI often 
have a prolonged hospital course, the guideline 
also includes information on prevention and 
management of acute autonomic dysreflexia, 
spasticity, pressure ulcers, and neurogenic bowel 
and bladder. The importance of early mobilization 
and rehabilitation is reviewed. The last two 
sections cover implementation of the Spine BPG 
into trauma center protocols and integration of this 
information into the trauma center’s performance 
improvement processes. BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES SPINE INJURY References .

The intent of the American College of Surgeons 
(ACS) Trauma Quality Programs (TQP) Best 
Practices Guidelines is to provide health 
care professionals with evidence-based 
recommendations regarding care of the trauma 
patient. The Best Practices Guidelines do not 
include all potential options for prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment, and are not intended 
as a substitute for the provider’s clinical 
judgment and experience. The responsible 
provider must make all treatment decisions 
based upon their independent judgment and the 
patient’s individual clinical presentation. The 
ACS and any entities endorsing the Guidelines 
shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages related 
to the use of the information contained herein. 
The ACS may modify the TQP Best Practices 
Guidelines at any time without notice. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine 
has reviewed this spinal cord injury best practice 
document and recommends it as an educational 
report. The rehabilitation key points in this 
document provide a practice-related, educational 
benefit to our members. DISCLAIMER IMPORTANT NOTE BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES SPINE INJURY KEY FACTORS OF 
THE INITIAL SPINE 
EVALUATION BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
KEY POINTS � Vehicular trauma and unintentional falls are the 
leading mechanisms of spinal cord injury. � Older adults are more susceptible to spinal injuries 
related to their increased risk for low velocity 
falls and the presence of underlying arthritic and 
osteoporotic conditions. Spinal cord injury (SCI) incidence varies worldwide, 
and in the United States an estimated  new cases 
per million population occur annually, not counting the 
cases who die before transport., Little populationbased data exists estimating the incidence of spinal 
column fractures (SCF) not associated with SCI; 
however, extrapolated data indicate the SCF incidence 
is approximately  times higher than SCI.– Of all 
blunt trauma patients included in the National Trauma 
Databank in , approximately  percent had at least 
one SCF. The SCI incidence rate remains relatively stable, but 
the total number of SCI cases has increased because 
of population growth.,– The epidemiology of these 
injuries has shifted, potentially reflecting changes in 
human behaviors or a higher rate of survival to hospital 
admission. The most important factor is the increased 
population of older adults who are particularly 
susceptible to spinal injuries.,,, 
Vehicular trauma consistently accounts for 
approximately  to  percent of SCI; however, 
unintentional falls, especially among older adults,  
are an increasingly important mechanism of injury, 
accounting for up to  percent of SCI in some countries  
(Figure ).,, Firearm injuries account for a small, but 
significant proportion of SCI (approximately  percent). 
Sports-related SCI varies between countries, and in 
some countries account for  percent of all SCI. Diving 
and skiing are the sports associated with the highest risk 
for SCI. Older adults are more susceptible to spinal injuries 
related to their increased risk for low velocity falls and 
the presence of underlying conditions (e.g., osteoporosis 
and osteopenia, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis) which may render 
the spine highly unstable even after a minor injury. 
Osteoporotic spinal fractures in older adults from 
low energy falls accounted for more than . million 
hospitalizations worldwide in , and this number 
has increased significantly.,, The upper cervical spine 
is the most common injury location in older adults. SCI 
in older adults tends to be incomplete, manifesting as 
central cord syndrome, cervical extension/distraction 
injuries, and odontoid fractures., Acute traumatic 
central cord syndrome due to cervical spondylosis is the 
most common incomplete SCI in this population. Figure .

The early mortality associated with SCF is estimated 
at approximately  percent, however, SCI has an 
associated mortality that is almost twice as high ( 
percent) with tetraplegic patients having the highest 
risk. After the acute phase, this mortality increases 
and almost doubles at one year. Compared with other 
trauma patients, those admitted with SCI injuries have 
a . fold increased length of stay, at approximately 
 days. Compared with SCF from other causes, 
such as osteoporosis, trauma accounts for the highest 
associated cost of hospitalization, although the 
treatment modality appears to be the main driver of 
cost. The total national charge attributable to SCIrelated hospitalizations was approximately $. billion 
in . Factors, such as need for re-hospitalization, 
post-injury rehabilitation, long-term complications, 
long-term care, and lost years of employment are not 
accounted for in these charges. Additionally, for SCF 
patients, charges do not account for the long-term 
recovery, chronic pain, and the inability to return to 
baseline activity level.

PRE-HOSPITAL SPINAL MOTION 
RESTRICTION 
KEY POINTS � Spinal motion restriction (SMR) can be achieved 
with a backboard, scoop stretcher, vacuum splint, 
ambulance cot, or other similar devices. � When SMR is indicated, apply it to the entire spine 
due to the risk of noncontiguous injuries. � Assure that a sufficient number of properly trained 
individuals are available to assist with patient 
transfers to minimize the risk for displacement of a 
potentially unstable spinal injury. The American College of Surgeons Committee 
on Trauma (ACS-COT), the American College of 
Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the National 
Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians 
(NAEMSP) recently published a detailed, joint 
consensus statement on spinal motion restriction for 
the trauma patient in the pre-hospital setting and during 
transport. 
The term “spinal motion restriction” (SMR) is 
recommended instead of immobilization, as current 
techniques limit or reduce undesired motion of 
the spine, but they do not provide true spinal 
immobilization. A backboard, scoop stretcher, vacuum 
splint, ambulance cot, or other similar devices may 
be used to achieve SMR. Refer to Table  for adult 
indications for SMR following blunt trauma. No role for 
SMR exists in penetrating trauma patients. 
When SMR is indicated in adults, apply it to the entire 
spine due to the risk of noncontiguous injuries. A critical 
component of SMR is the application of an appropriate 
size cervical collar. Keep the head, neck, and torso in 
alignment by placing the patient on a long backboard, 
a scoop stretcher, a vacuum mattress, or an ambulance 
cot. SMR cannot be properly performed with a patient in 
a sitting position. 
All patient transfers pose a risk for a displacement of 
an unstable spine injury. Minimize flexion, extension, 
and rotation with the use of a long spine board, a scoop 
stretcher, or a vacuum mattress. 
Consider removal of extrication devices during transport 
only if an adequate number of trained personnel are 
present to minimize unnecessary movement during the 
removal process. The risks of patient manipulation must 
be weighed against the benefits of device removal. If 
transport time is expected to be short, it may be better 
to transport a patient on the device and remove it on 
arrival at the hospital. 
Once at the hospital, expeditiously evaluate patients for 
removal from the long backboard, scoop stretcher, or 
vacuum mattress. Facilities need a procedure to assure 
that a sufficient number of properly trained individuals 
are available to assist with patient transfers so the risk 
of inadvertent displacement of a potentially unstable 
spinal injury is minimized. Reducing the number of 
patient transfers is also important. References .

KEY POINTS � The cervical collar can be discontinued without 
additional radiographic imaging in an awake, 
asymptomatic, adult trauma patient presenting with 
all of the following: a normal neurological exam, no 
high-risk injury mechanism, free range of cervical 
motion, and no neck tenderness. 
� Removal of a cervical collar is recommended for 
adult blunt trauma patients who are neurological 
asymptomatic and have a negative helical cervical 
computed tomography (CT) imaging. � A negative helical cervical CT scan is recommended 
as sufficient to remove a C-collar in an adult blunt 
trauma patient who is obtunded/unevaluable. In the setting of acute trauma, improper cervical spine 
(C-spine) motion restriction and delayed diagnosis 
can lead to catastrophic neurological damage.– Blunt 
trauma is associated with a  to . percent risk of 
C-spine injury (boney and/or ligamentous ). The 
recommended standard of care for patients transported 
by emergency medical services (EMS) is maintenance 
of C-spine motion restriction until further assessment 
by an appropriate provider. Annually, approximately  
million patients are placed in cervical collars. C-spine motion restriction is a critical component of 
initial trauma management, as is timely clearance and 
removal of the cervical collar, as well as backboards 
and other devices, used for spinal motion restriction. 
Risks associated with prolonged cervical collar use 
include delayed tracheostomy, deep venous thrombosis, 
aspiration, pneumonia, increased intracranial pressure, 
pressure ulcers, and difficult airway management.,, 
Guidance from recent studies update the  Guidelines 
for the Management of Acute Cervical and Spinal Cord 
Injuries for the management of cervical collars in adult 
patients, and is summarized below. 
Awake, Asymptomatic Patient 
The asymptomatic, awake blunt trauma patient is 
the most common presentation for evaluation of 
C-spine injury and removal of cervical collars placed 
in the pre-hospital setting.Two established criteria 
guiding C-spine evaluation are the National Emergency 
X-Radiography Utilization Study Group (NEXUS) rules 
and the Canadian C-Spine rules (CCR)., 
The NEXUS criteria were derived from the study of 
, asymptomatic patients in a cohort of , 
blunt trauma patients conducted before the routine, 
systematic use of CT scans. All patients had standard 
-view cervical x-rays and cervical CT scans as deemed 
necessary. Five essential criteria for low risk of cervical 
injury were identified: no posterior midline-cervical 
tenderness, no neurological deficit, normal alertness, 
no evidence of intoxication, and no painful distracting 
injury. The resulting analysis revealed a negative 
predictive value of . percent and sensitivity of . 
percent (Level I evidence) for traumatic cervical injury. 
The CCR study examined three criteria in , adults 
to warrant further imaging and continued motion 
restriction of the C-spine. Patients were screened first 
for high risk injury factors (e.g., older than  years, 
dangerous mechanism, or abnormal neurological exam). 
Patients then needed to meet low risk-factor criteria 
[simple rear-end motor vehicle collision, sitting in the 
emergency department (ED), ambulatory at the time 
of injury, delayed (not immediate) onset of neck pain, 
or absence of midline C-spine tenderness] before 
performance of a cervical range of motion assessment. 
During the cervical range of motion test, patients were 
asked to move their head  degrees to the right and 
left. Failure (pain or inability to perform free range 
of motion) warrants further imaging and continued 
C-spine motion restriction. The CCR sensitivity for 
C-spine injury was reported at  percent. In , 
a comparative prospective analysis of the NEXUS 
and CCR criteria found that the CCR criteria were 
significantly more sensitive and reduced the need for 
additional radiographic assessment when compared 
with NEXUS. 
BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY CERVICAL COLLAR CLEARANCE In , a meta-analysis of  Class  medical studies 
used rigid inclusion criteria for the clearance of cervical 
collars. It was determined that a patient meeting the 
following criteria did not require further radiographic 
assessment to clear the cervical collar (negative 
predictive value of . percent and a sensitivity of . 
percent): 
� Alert/unaltered 
� Asymptomatic with no neurological deficit 
� Complete a free range of cervical motion exam 
� No sign of a distracting injury An awake, asymptomatic adult trauma patient with 
a normal neurological exam, without a high-risk 
injury mechanism, free range of cervical motion, who 
presents without neck tenderness can have the cervical 
collar discontinued without additional radiographic 
assessment. 
Awake Symptomatic Patient 
Awake patients who fail the initial assessment for 
cervical collar clearance require proper radiographic 
evaluation for C-spine injury. Past recommendations 
suggested the use of plain radiograph to assess for 
clinically relevant fractures.However, multiple 
randomized control trials with Class I evidence now 
consider plain radiography to be insufficient to identify 
clinically relevant fractures.Plain films have a 
sensitivity ranging from  to  percent while modern 
helical cervical CT scans have sensitivity as high as  
percent. The Western Trauma Association studied more 
than , patients and found CT had sensitivity of 
. percent for cervical injury (Level II evidence). 
Duane et al. prospectively studied more than , 
patients and determined a CT sensitivity of  percent 
for cervical injury (Level III evidence). 
The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 
a negative CT was questioned for awake patients 
with continued neurological symptoms. In , a 
prospective study of , patients by Inaba, et al. 
found only three false negative CT scans that missed 
clinically relevant symptoms consistent with central 
cord syndrome. Study authors recommended 
that patients with negative CT scans but persistent 
neurological symptoms have an MRI. In , Maung et 
al. found that patients with a negative CT but persistent 
neurological symptoms had an abnormal MRI rate of 
. percent; however, a definitive statement on the 
clinical significance of these findings could not be 
made because only . percent of patients had surgery 
after MRI (Level IV evidence). A study by Malhotra 
et al. with  patients having a negative CT found 
. percent had an abnormal MRI, and . percent 
of patients had a change in management due to MRI 
findings (Level III evidence). A meta-analysis of  
studies demonstrated an exceptionally low rate ( 
missed injuries in , patients) of unstable fractures 
missed by CT and found on MRI (Level  evidence). Removal of a cervical collar is recommended for 
adult blunt trauma patients who are neurological 
asymptomatic with a negative helical cervical CT. 
MRI is not required for removal of a cervical collar. 
However, at the treating physician’s discretion, it can 
be considered in patients with persistent neurological 
symptoms, concern for ligamentous damage, high risk 
degenerative/pathological changes, despite a negative 
CT scan. Obtunded and Unevaluable Patient The proper radiographic assessment for obtunded 
or unevaluable patients is extremely important given 
the difficulty in accurate clinical assessment and 
concern for an unidentified injury causing catastrophic 
neurological damage. The  guidelines highlighted 
the inadequacy of dynamic imaging (flexion-extension 
films), and its use was not recommended for initial 
clearance.,,An  study meta-analysis ( total 
patients) determined that the diagnostic utility of MRI in 
CT-negative obtunded patients was clinically significant, 
altering management in  percent of patients (Level II 
evidence). A second meta-analysis by Muchow et al., 
determined that MRI identified . percent of injuries 
not diagnosed on initial radiograph or CT imaging, and 
recommended that MRI become the gold standard. 
These studies were criticized because of serious 
design flaws, including false endpoints, poorly matched 
populations, inclusion of a pediatric study, and dissimilar 
imaging protocols. The  guidelines recommended 
the possible use of MRI after a normal CT for patients 
who are obtunded/unevaluable. BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY CERVICAL COLLAR CLEARANCE A more recent -study meta-analysis with , 
obtunded/intubated patients by Panczykowski et al. 
reported a negative predictive value of  percent, 
and both a sensitivity and specificity greater than 
. percent with a modern helical CT. The analysis 
confirms that a modern helical CT scan alone is 
sufficient to clear the cervical collar in the obtunded/ unevaluable patient. A -study meta-analysis with 
, obtunded patients by Raza et al. reported a 
normal CT sensitivity of . percent and negative 
predictive value of . percent. The authors also 
reported their own retrospective cohort of  obtunded 
trauma patients with a CT and MRI and reported a CT 
sensitivity of  percent. Badhiwala et al. conducted a 
detailed subset analysis of studies with high quality CT 
(mm slices) and found that after a negative CT that 
MRI did not change the management (collar or surgery) 
for any patient. 
In , the Eastern Association for the Surgery of 
Trauma (EAST) updated its recommendation for 
C-spine evaluation to a Level III recommendation: a 
negative helical CT is sufficient for clearing the C-spine 
and removing cervical collars. Several subsequent 
studies re-affirmed this recommendation. Inaba et al. 
prospectively studied , patients and documented 
that high quality CT scan had a sensitivity and negative 
predictive value of . percent and . percent, 
respectively. Judicious use of MRI was recommended 
for suspected neurological compromise. Duane et 
al. examined a more than , patients and noted 
no missed cervical injuries in obtunded/unevaluable 
patients with negative CT scans. 
A negative helical cervical CT scan is recommended as 
sufficient to remove a cervical collar in an obtunded/ unevaluable adult blunt trauma patient. When available, 
obtain spine surgeon consultation about the need 
for cervical MRI for patients when concerned about 
neurological symptoms and/or ligamentous injury 
referable to the spinal column. 
Special Considerations: Older Adult Patients The NEXUS criteria do not include age-related 
contingencies, while the CCR considers age greater 
than  years as a risk a factor. The  SCI guidelines, 
along with the EAST guidelines, do not mention any 
special consideration for older adult patients. Healey  
et al. reported that  percent of patients older than  
years with spine fractures were asymptomatic, with no 
midline tenderness on presentation for blunt trauma. 
The reported rate of cervical surgery for “asymptomatic” 
patients older than  years was similar to the 
“symptomatic” population (Level III evidence). The 
authors concluded that pain was not equally assessed 
in the older population. A study applying the NEXUS 
criteria to an older adult trauma population (older than 
 years) found a sensitivity of  percent (Level III 
evidence). The ACS TQIP Best Practices Guidelines in 
Imaging recommend more liberal imaging for older 
adults. References

BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY IMAGING 
coronal, and sagittal planes in the cervical spine. When 
combined with a CT of the brain, the cervical spine CT 
can be completed rapidly. The current recommendation 
from the American College of Radiology Practice 
Parameter for the performance of CT of the spine is for 
slices no greater than  mm when imaging the cervical 
spine, which differs from the ACS TQIP Best Practices 
Guidelines in Imaging published in . The thoracolumbar spine is imaged in the same 
fashion with slice thickness not to exceed  mm. 
Thoracolumbar spine imaging may be reconstructed 
from images concurrently obtained for evaluation of the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis in a multi-trauma patient. 
Routine reformatting of these images is not required. 
A more selective imaging approach is appropriate for 
patients with a high suspicion of spine injury or when an 
injury is identified on the non-reformatted images. Despite the high sensitivity of the MDCT in identifying 
bony abnormalities, interpretation may be difficult 
in patients with severe degenerative changes or 
osteopenia. In addition, ligamentous or cord injuries will 
not be depicted, although they may be suggested by 
certain patterns of injury, indicating a requirement for 
MRI. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Although MDCT of the spine is considered the first 
line imaging modality in the acute setting, MRI often 
provides complimentary data, especially in patients 
with discordant CT and clinical findings. MRI allows for 
direct visualization of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and 
discs, and it provides better soft-tissue contrast. It is the 
only modality for evaluating the internal structure of the 
spinal cord. 
Obtain an MRI after consultation with a spine specialist, 
if able. MRI findings, especially in the acute setting, 
may mislead clinicians. Clinically insignificant soft 
tissue abnormalities may be detected that may trigger 
additional, unnecessary workup or interventions., 
MRI has a role as a complementary imaging study for 
patients with SCF identified on MDCT, when a concern 
exists about spinal stability and/or SCI, and when a 
surgical intervention is planned. 
IMAGING 
KEY POINTS � Plain radiographs of the cervical and thoracolumbar 
spine are not recommended in the initial screening of 
spinal trauma because of their low sensitivity. � Non-contrast, multidetector computerized 
tomography (MDCT) is the initial imaging modality 
of choice to evaluate the cervical and thoracolumbar 
spine. � MRI is the only modality for evaluating the internal 
structure of the spinal cord. � Consider universal screening for blunt 
cerebrovascular injury for all patients with major 
trauma using a whole-body CT scan. After using the clinical decision rules and assessing risk 
for SCF or SCI during the primary and secondary survey, 
patients at risk for spinal trauma are further evaluated 
with dedicated imaging studies. The aim of imaging 
is to avoid preventable neurological deterioration 
and to guide shortand long-term management of 
spinal injury. Plain radiographs of the cervical and 
thoracolumbar spine are not recommended in the 
initial screening of spinal trauma because of their low 
sensitivity. Computerized Tomography (CT) Non-contrast, MDCT is the initial imaging modality of 
choice to evaluate both the cervical and thoracolumbar 
spine. The sensitivity of this modality exceeds  
percent for the cervical spine and approaches  
percent for the thoracolumbar spine. The use of MDCT 
offers a significant increase in imaging acquisition 
speed and in high spatial resolution, with increased 
coverage of the patient. Three-dimensional images are 
easily obtained and offer greater detail. Overall, this 
technology offers a high degree capability and utility for 
examining the spine. The cervical spine is imaged from the skull base or 
craniocervical junction, through the cervicothoracic 
junction. Thinner slices increase sensitivity but may add 
to the radiation burden. Slices of no greater than  mm 
are recommended to obtain reformatted images in axial, 
BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY IMAGING 
Spine fractures are the single-most predictive factor 
of BCVI, with greatest risk to the vertebral artery., 
Angiography studies reveal that up to  percent of 
patients with a C-spine injury have a concomitant 
vertebral artery injury. The highest-risk C-spine injury 
is subluxation, followed by fractures involving the 
transverse foramen and the high cervical spine at C 
to C., Patients with minor cervical injuries including 
vertebral body and laminar factures are the lowest risk 
for BCVI, but a reported association is still present. 
Elderly patients with low-energy injury mechanisms, 
including ground level falls are at risk for BCVI. 
Radiographic screening for BCVI with CT angiography 
is a sufficient and cost effective modality, and it is the 
recommended means of excluding this injury.,, 
Traditional screening criteria can miss  to  percent 
of BCVI.,, Despite an increase in the number of 
screening indications, BCVI are still missed., Several 
studies now recommend universal screening for all 
patients with major trauma using a whole-body CT 
scan (WBCT).,, The WBCT includes a noncontrast 
CT head followed by a multi-slice CT scan ( or  
slice), incorporating a single IV contrast-enhanced 
pass from the circle of Willis through the pelvis. This 
imaging allows screening for BCVI while evaluating the 
cervical spine, chest, abdomen and pelvis.,, Although 
some authors question the benefit of a universal WBCT 
scan for trauma patients, the practice is supported by 
the American College of Radiology’s Appropriate Use 
Criteria of CT scans for major blunt trauma., When a 
BCVI is found, initiate treatment with anti-coagulation 
or anti-platelet agents, if indicated once deemed 
clinically safe. References .

MRI may be selectively performed in patients with 
clinical findings that do not correlate with the MDCT 
findings. Examples include patients with neurological 
deficits and a normal spine MDCT, and patients with 
out-of-proportion pain and a normal MDCT, or a 
MDCT demonstrating severe degenerative changes or 
osteopenia. 
It is not necessary to perform routine MRI for 
unevaluable patients with a normal MDCT and no 
apparent neurological deficit to complete the screening 
for spinal injuries., In comparison to MDCT, MRI requires significantly 
more time for completion. The patient must be 
cooperative and avoid movement for the duration of 
the study. Conducting an MRI may pose challenges 
when evaluating the following patients: on a ventilator, 
hemodynamic instability, are claustrophobic, or unable 
to remain still for a prolonged period of time. Often, the 
help of anesthesia is requested and occasionally, some 
patients require endotracheal intubation and sedation 
to complete the MRI. The presence of metallic implants 
may interfere with the images, and they may preclude 
patients from having the MRI performed. Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury 
Blunt force trauma resulting in blunt cerebrovascular 
injury (BCVI) has a reported incidence of . percent to 
. percent., Undetected carotid and vertebral artery 
injury can lead to delayed therapy and increase the 
patient’s risk of stroke. Untreated carotid and vertebral 
artery injuries have a mortality as high as  percent 
and  percent, respectively. Initial clinical symptoms 
needing further investigation include the following: � Carotid bruit, 
� Expanding neck hematoma, 
� Neurological deficit, 
� Evidence of ischemic stroke on head imaging, and � Arterial bleeding. 
High-risk patients can present with both carotid and 
vertebral injury.

. BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY shock is present and unexplained by hypovolemia 
and/or bleeding, especially when associated with 
bradycardia. 
Be extremely cautious about attributing observed signs 
to a SCI when other life-threatening causes have not 
been adequately excluded, such as circulatory shock 
from bleeding. The primary survey is not intended to 
fully evaluate the spine during the initial evaluation for 
life-threatening injuries. However, if any clinical signs 
suggestive of SCI are identified, rapidly determine the 
level of injury because this information will aid in the 
differential diagnosis of observed signs and symptoms 
and will facilitate targeted treatment. 
Spinal Motion Restriction during the Primary Survey. 
The same principles of pre-hospital SMR are applied 
during the primary survey. Refer to the section on 
Pre-Hospital Spinal Motion Restriction on page . 
Attempting to align the spine to aid with SMR is 
acceptable. Do not, under any circumstances, use force 
to move the patient’s neck or thoracolumbar spine 
into a position that elicits pain. Remove the backboard 
expeditiously to minimize the risk of pressure ulcers 
and unnecessary discomfort. Maintaining a patient in a 
supine position on the firm gurney has the same SMR 
result as use of a backboard. Perform all additional 
examinations by log rolling the patient when necessary. Airway Management. Securing the airway may be 
required during the primary survey. Secondary injuries 
to the spinal cord may result from inadequate SMR 
during airway maneuvers. However, most secondary 
injuries likely result from ongoing cord ischemia and/ or edema, assuming that a reasonable effort was made 
to maintain SMR. Complete immobilization of the 
cervical spine during endotracheal intubation is virtually 
impossible, and some degree of movement of the neck 
is to be expected., It is important to make the effort to 
maintain SMR. Suggested strategies include: � Maintain the cervical collar during airway 
manipulations. 
� Apply manual inline stabilization of the head and 
neck with the removal of the anterior portion of the 
collar to allow for a wider mouth opening and easier 
visualization of the oropharynx and cords. 
� Secure the airway with an endotracheal tube using 
direct laryngoscopy or awake intubation with a 
bronchoscope. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
KEY POINTS � Using the International Standards for Neurological 
Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) clinical 
documentation tool is a best practice. � The neurologic level of injury is determined from the 
assessment of sensory and motor levels of injury. 
� Make no assumptions about the extent of the 
neurologic injury in the presence of a depressed level 
of consciousness, extremity or pelvic fractures, burns 
or other injuries, such as to the brachial plexus, that 
may affect the results of sensory or motor deficit 
evaluation. 
Initially evaluate all trauma patients based on the 
principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support®, 
independent of whether an SCF or SCI is suspected or 
confirmed. 
Primary Survey Conduct the primary survey focusing on hemorrhage 
control, airway, breathing, circulation, disability, 
and exposure. Maintain cervical and thoracolumbar 
SMR throughout this phase, until the spine is further 
evaluated during the secondary survey. The primary 
goal during the “disability” evaluation, after assessing 
the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and pupillary 
response, is to identify any lateralizing signs by 
conducting a rapid assessment of motor function and 
reflexes in the extremities. In alert and cooperative 
patients, simply ask them to raise upper and lower 
extremities sequentially and observe for any differences. Signs observed during the primary survey suggestive of 
an SCI include the following: 
� Absence of equal movement in the upper and/or 
lower extremities that may be combined with a gross 
sensory deficit. 
� Complete or partial loss of muscle tone and loss of 
bladder or bowel function. 
� Priapism may be observed in male patients. 
Subtle signs of a SCI may include tachypnea and 
diaphragmatic breathing in high level SCI. Raise 
your index of suspicion when other explanations for 
these signs are adequately ruled out. Consider an SCI 
associated with neurogenic shock when circulatory 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
Review the patient’s past medical history to assess 
the risk for an injury. Osteoporosis is one of the 
most common pathologies placing older adults at 
risk for spinal injury. Other pre-existing conditions 
may also play a role, such as spinal lytic lesions from 
metastatic cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing 
spondylitis., Seek information about pre-existing 
neurologic deficits, because they have implications in 
the assessment of acute SCI. Inquire about any history 
of prior injuries to the spine and the presence of spinal 
implants from prior surgeries or interventions. Associated Injuries. Consider all trauma patients who 
present with severe injuries at high risk for associated 
spinal trauma. Similarly, consider the presence of 
specific injuries identified during the primary and 
secondary survey when assessing the risk for a spinal 
injury. For example, traumatic brain injuries (TBI), 
manifested by a decreased GCS score, place trauma 
patients at a high risk for an associated C-spine 
injury.– Complex maxillofacial trauma, especially 
when a result of high energy mechanism, is another 
example.,– A high proportion of patients with a pelvic 
fracture have associated spinal trauma to the cervical, 
thoracolumbar and sacral region. Thoracic trauma, 
including multiple rib fractures, sternal, scapular and 
clavicular fractures increase the risk for associated 
cervical and thoracic spinal injuries., Calcaneal 
fractures resulting from a fall from height, indicate 
a spinal injury risk, usually at the level of the lumbar 
region. Patients who present with a seatbelt-shaped 
abdominal contusion are also at risk for thoracolumbar 
spine trauma from a flexion-distraction injury., 
Also consider patients to be at high risk who require 
emergent surgical exploration for a gunshot wound or 
blunt traumatic injury, when an associated spinal injury 
may be found on postoperative imaging.– Structured Spine Physical Examination 
A structured physical examination of the entire spine is 
performed during the secondary survey with inline SMR. 
A comprehensive neurological evaluation is performed. Cervical Spine. Ask the patient to not move the neck as 
the cervical collar is opened, flipping the anterior portion 
to one side. SMR is applied as the examiner inspects 
the neck for abrasions, contusions, hematomas, or open 
Surgeons are encouraged to familiarize themselves 
with techniques to rapidly and safely secure the airway, 
because no specific technique has proven superior to 
another. Secondary Survey 
The secondary survey aims to obtain a full and detailed 
history and physical examination after completion of 
the primary survey, and the patient is deemed to be 
stable and have no life-threatening injuries. The clinical 
decision tools to identify patients at risk for a spinal 
injury require further imaging investigative studies. 
Documentation. For patients with suspected SCI, 
clearly detail the complete neurologic evaluation. Serial 
documentation of abnormal physical findings during 
subsequent evaluations allows for early identification 
of secondary injuries which may have implications in 
management decisions. Ensure this documentation 
includes the date and time performed and name of the 
examiner. 
Mechanism of Injury. Mechanism of injury (MOI) often 
aids in the assessment of the risk for SCF and SCI. Any 
high-energy mechanism may result in spinal trauma. 
Examples include: high speed motor vehicle collisions 
(especially when associated with ejection or roll over); 
motorcycle, bicycle, and recreational vehicle collisions; 
crush injuries; falls from height; injuries leading to an 
axial load to the head (e.g., diving and auto versus 
pedestrian).,– 
Low energy mechanisms, such as ground level falls, 
place older adults at a high risk for SCF and SCI.– 
Age by itself, is considered a high-risk factor for 
spinal trauma, independent of mechanism. Factors 
contributing to this high risk include osteoporosis, 
osteopenia, and a generalized decrease in the spinal 
column’s physiologic protective capabilities due to 
degenerative and other age-related changes. 
History. If the patient is evaluable and cooperative, 
ask about neurologic signs and symptoms. Ask about 
the presence of new onset neck or back pain, any 
associated neurological deficit in the upper and/or lower 
extremities, such as abnormal sensation (numbness, 
tingling) or motor deficit. However, absence of such 
symptoms with a distracting injury may be misleading. 
BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
When an SCI is suspected, perform a digital rectal exam 
before rolling the patient back to the supine position 
after removal of the backboard. The physical examination of the thoracolumbar 
spine has very low sensitivity. The level of pain and/ or tenderness often does not correlate with the level 
of injury on imaging. Most importantly, however, a 
normal exam has a low sensitivity in ruling out these 
injuries.,, The International Standards for Neurological 
Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) When a SCI is suspected, attempt to rapidly identify the 
level of injury. The ISNCSCI is a clinical documentation 
tool published by the American Spinal Injury Association 
(ASIA) and maintained by the International Standards 
Committee of ASIA and the International Spinal Cord 
Society (ISCoS). A best practice is use of this tool to 
document the level and severity of a SCI (refer to  
Figure ). See guidelines for assessment and 
documentation that follow. wounds. The entire cervical spine is palpated along the 
midline (spinous processes) while evaluating for pain 
and/or tenderness, step offs, and any other deformities. 
The paraspinal regions are also evaluated bilaterally 
for the presence of tenderness, pain and/or muscle 
contraction. The cervical collar is then secured in place. 
To complete the examination of the cervical spine, the 
same steps are repeated when the patient is logrolled to 
evaluate the thoracolumbar spine. Thoracolumbar and Sacral Spine. Perform this 
examination when the backboard is removed, if present. 
The complete evaluation of the thoracolumbar spine 
requires the patient to be in a standing, sitting, supine, 
and prone position. However, this is not feasible when 
SMR must be maintained during the acute phase of 
trauma care, until an injury has been ruled out. With 
the patient logrolled using inline SMR, inspect the back 
for obvious spinal deformities, as well as contusions, 
abrasions, hematomas, and/or open wounds. The 
cervical spine region is also inspected to complete 
that examination. Systematically palpate the entire 
thoracolumbar and sacral midline to evaluate for pain, 
tenderness, step offs, gaps or any other deformities.

Be aware that this tool does not include all the elements 
of a comprehensive neurological examination, such as 
deep tendon reflexes or evaluation of position sense. It 
includes elements only required to determine the ASIA 
impairment scale (AIS), i.e., the sensory and motor level 
of injury. Nonetheless, its performance with the patient 
in a supine position with the use of common clinical 
measures, minimal equipment, and in virtually any 
clinical setting or phase of care, makes it an attractive 
and useful tool when evaluating patients with SCI. Sensory Level of Injury. The sensory level refers to the 
most caudal segment of the spinal cord with normal 
sensory function. This level is evaluated by examining 
the corresponding dermatomes. Figure  outlines the 
distribution of dermatomes and Table  lists these 
distributions. Perform a systematic assessment of sensory level with 
light touch and a pinprick of each dermatome using the 
face as control. Grade each sensory level as:
 = Absent
 = Altered (either decreased/impaired sensation or  
      hypersensitivity)
 = Normal NT = Not testable An asterisk “*” tag is added to grades ,  or NT in 
the ASIA worksheet (the only abnormal indicators) 
when an impairment is due to a non-SCI condition. 
Additional Guidance: 
� Perform the light touch sensory scoring with strokes 
(not to exceed  cm) across the skin using a cotton 
tip applicator. 
� Test the dermatomes in the anterior torso (chest and 
abdomen) at the midclavicular line. 
� Perform the pinprick (sharp-dull discrimination) 
sensory scoring with a clean safety pin. Apply a 
single sharp and dull stimulus using consistent 
pressure with the safety pin. 
� The most caudal aspect of the spinal cord (S/S) is 
examined in the same fashion as all dermatomes. 
� A digital rectal examination is performed to determine sensory awareness. It is recorded as present or absent deep anal pressure. 
After determining the sensory level on the right and left 
sides for light touch and pinprick, the most caudate level 
where sensation is normal bilaterally (grade of  for both, 
right and left) is reported as the normal sensory level.

An asterisk “*” tag is added to , , , ,  or NT (e.g., 
the only abnormal indicators) when an impairment is 
due to a non-SCI condition in the ASIA worksheet. Additional Guidance: 
� Assign a score for each key muscle group of the right 
and left upper and lower extremities. 
� Complete the motor assessment by evaluating the 
contraction of the external anal sphincter around the 
examiner’s finger. Scoring is reported as present or 
absent voluntary anal contraction. 
� The normal motor level on each side is determined 
by a minimum score of , with all the proximal key 
muscle groups being  (normal.) 
� The overall motor level score is the last normal for 
both (a minimum of  bilaterally.) If for any reason 
the motor level cannot be tested or determined, the 
motor level score is considered to be the same as the 
sensory level score. Motor Level of Injury. The strength of five key muscle 
groups in the upper extremities and five in the lower 
extremities is tested bilaterally to determine the motor 
level of injury (Table .) Provide resistance to the 
movement of muscle groups in both directions and

light touch and pinprick sensation are intact at the  
S/S level, and deep anal pressure and voluntary anal 
contraction are present. The zone of partial preservation is 
reported only for complete injuries, and it refers to those 
dermatomes and myotomes caudal to the sensory and 
motor levels that remain partially innervated. 
At this point, an ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) 
classification is assigned, based on whether the injury 
is complete (ASIA-A) or incomplete (ASIA-B, C, or D), 
which is based on the preservation of sensory and/or 
motor function and the number of key muscle groups 
with partial preservation (Table ). Neurological Level of Injury (NLI). The neurologic level 
of injury is defined as the levels where motor function 
and sensation are both intact bilaterally: � The most distal or caudal level at which the motor 
(minimum strength of  bilaterally with all levels 
proximally being ) plus � The most distal level where sensation is intact on 
light touch and pinprick with all proximal levels being 
intact. Description of the NLI is reported as complete or 
incomplete. The injury is considered incomplete when 
sacral sparing exists. Sacral sparing is present when 
Table . ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) and description of associated deficits ASIA Impairment Scale Description of Deficits Asia-A: Complete No sensory or motor function is preserved in the sacral segments S-. Asia-B: Sensory Incomplete Sensory, but not motor function, is preserved below the neurological level and includes the sacral segments 
S-S (light touch or pin prick at S-S or deep anal pressure) AND no motor function is preserved more 
than three levels below the motor level on either side of the body. Asia-C: Motor Incomplete Motor function is preserved at the most caudal sacral segments for voluntary anal contraction OR the 
patient meets the criteria for sensory incomplete status (sensory function preserved at the most caudal 
sacral segments S-S by light touch, pinprick or deep anal pressure), and has some sparing of motor 
function more than three levels below the ipsilateral motor level on either side of the body. (This includes 
key or non-key muscle functions to determine motor incomplete status.) For AIS C – less than half of key 
muscle functions below the single NLI have a muscle grade ≥ . Asia D: Motor Incomplete Motor incomplete status as defined above, with at least half (half or more) of key muscle functions below 
the single NLI having a muscle grade ≥ . Asia E: Normal If sensation and motor function, as tested with the ISNCSCI, are graded as normal in all segments, and the 
patient had prior deficits, then the AIS grade is E. Someone without an initial SCI does not receive an AIS 
grade. ND For documentation of the sensory, motor and NLI levels, the ASIA-AIS, and/or the zone of partial

Proprioception. Proprioception is an individual’s ability 
to determine body segment positions and movements 
in space. Orient the patient first. Ask them to close 
their eyes and report movement when a joint is flexed 
and extended, and then to discriminate between 
flexion and extension. The exam starts distally, at 
the interphalangeal joint of the big toes bilaterally, 
and continues proximally to the ankle, knee, and hip. 
Examination of the upper extremity joints is performed 
starting at the metacarpophalangeal joint, and continues 
proximally to the wrist, elbow and shoulder. 
Tertiary Survey. A tertiary survey is conducted after 
admission when the patient is stabilized and all injuries 
were addressed. Also perform another complete 
evaluation of the spine, especially if no imaging was 
previously performed. Obtain imaging at admission and 
during the hospital course as needed. Review imaging to 
rule out a missed spinal injury. 
The Patient Who Cannot Be Evaluated. A depressed 
level of consciousness is a risk factor for an associated 
spinal injury. When completing the physical examination 
described above is not feasible, use imaging studies 
to evaluate these patients while maintaining SMR. 
The presence of extremity or pelvic fractures, burns, 
or other injuries, such as to the brachial plexus, may 
affect the results of sensory or motor deficit evaluation. 
Clearly document these limitations or factors and 
make no assumptions about the absence or presence 
of a neurological deficit. Perform a comprehensive 
examination of the spine as soon as the patient 
becomes evaluable.

It has implications for spinal trauma, because any 
deficits may indicate TBI and a higher associated risk for 
spinal injury. Certain maneuvers to test these, e.g. the 
oculocephalic reflex (“doll’s eyes”), may not be feasible 
initially when the requirement for SMR exists. 
Reflexes. The deep tendon reflexes are tested by 
stimulating a muscle stretch (myotatic) with the use of a 
percussion hammer. Reflexes represent the sensory and 
motor functionality of motor fibers of a respective spinal 
level. Test reflexes bilaterally and note asymmetries. 
Some reflexes are graded simply as present or absent, 
such as the plantar stimulation and the bulbocavernosus 
reflex. Other reflexes are rated based on a scale from  
to , as follows:
 = Absent reflex + = Trace response + = Normal response + = Brisk response + = Non-sustained clonus (repetitive vibratory  
          movements) + = Sustained clonus Commonly examined reflexes include the biceps (C/ C,) triceps (C,) patellar (L/L/L,) ankle (S,) and 
plantar flexion (S). In the acute phase of a complete 
SCI, all reflexes below the level of injury are absent, 
however, bulbocavernosus reflex (S-S) may remain 
intact. Assess the bulbocavernosus reflex by briskly 
squeezing the glans penis or clitoris, or by pulling gently 
on the bladder indwelling catheter, while feeling for 
increased rectal tone. Absence of this reflex indicates 
the presence of spinal shock which usually resolves 
within a few hours to days. Return of this reflex with 
continued absence of all other reflexes below the level of 
injury indicates a complete SCI. With spinal shock, the 
bulbocavernosus reflex returns first and other reflexes 
follow gradually. Complete resolution of spinal shock is 
preceded by a phase of hyperreflexia. BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

SYSTEMS 
KEY POINTS � Spine trauma classification systems include specific 
injury characteristics, as well as the patient’s medical 
or neurologic status. � Patient scores for the classification system are 
used to guide decision making regarding surgery or 
nonsurgical management. The use of a spine trauma classification system helps 
evaluate the urgency and severity of spinal injury 
with other concomitant injuries in the polytrauma 
patient. It also facilitates communication among the 
multidisciplinary team including emergency physicians, 
intensivists, and surgeons. Many classification systems previously proposed 
for spinal trauma ranged from anatomic criteria to 
mechanistic descriptions. Fractures and dislocations 
of the spine were originally described based on 
their stability, with risk for increased deformity and 
subsequent neurological injury.– While these systems 
incorporated morphological characteristics and inferred 
spinal stability from radiological assessment, important 
factors such as the patient’s medical or neurological 
status were not integrated. 
Novel comprehensive classification systems were 
developed using literature reviews and expert 
consensus to address these limitations and to facilitate 
communication and guide treatment. Examples include 
the Cervical Subaxial Injury Classification System (SLIC) 
and the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System 
(TLICS)., Both systems include the patient’s neurologic 
status in a point-based scoring system. The AO Spine 
Injury Classification System was developed as a more 
comprehensive evaluation system that also includes 
the upper cervical spine, sacral injuries, and patient 
characteristics such as underlying medical condition, 
and other spinal disorders. 
Cervical Subaxial Injury Classification System 
(SLIC) The SLIC describes injuries to the subaxial cervical 
spine (C-C) and is a point-based system. It consists 
of  categories: fracture morphology, integrity of the 
discoligamentous complex (DLC), and neurological 
status (refer to Table ). 
SPINE INJURY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS 
Table . Cervical Subaxial Injury Classification (SLIC) Injury Morphology (Max ) Points � No fracture/abnormality � Compression � Burst + = 
� Distraction (e.g., hyperextension, facet perch) � Rotation/translation (e.g., facet dislocation, unstable tear-drop, advanced flexion compression injury) Disco-ligamentous Complex (DLC) Integrity (Max ) � Intact � Indeterminate (isolated interspinous space widening, signal change on MRI only). � Disrupted (e.g., widening of disc space, facet perch or facet dislocation) Neurological Injury (Max ) � Intact � Root Injury � Complete spinal cord injury � Incomplete spinal cord injury � Ongoing cord compression in setting of neurological deficit + Adapted from: Vaccaro AR, Hulbert RJ, Patel AA, et al. The Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System. Spine (Phila Pa ). ; (): –. doi:./ BRS.beb BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY SPINE INJURY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS 
Based on the recommendations of this system, injuries 
with a total SLIC score of are treated nonoperatively, 
those with a total score ≥  are best treated operatively, 
whereas those with a score of  can be treated 
operatively or nonoperatively, based on the treating 
physician’s best judgment. Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System 
(TLICS) The TLICS classification, describing injuries to the 
thoracolumbar spine, is also comprised of three 
categories: injury morphology, integrity of the posterior 
ligamentous complex (PLC), and neurologic status 
(Table ). 
Fracture morphology grading is based on fracture 
patterns discerned on CT scans. 
� Compression injuries are noted as visible loss of 
height through part or an entire vertebral body 
(including traditional “burst” fractures) and are 
assigned either  or  points. 
� Distraction injuries (more severe injuries evidenced 
by anatomic dissociation in the sagittal plane) are 
given  points. These include flexion-distraction 
injuries with facet perch that disrupt the strong 
capsular constraints and bony articulation of 
the facet joints posteriorly, as well as extensiondistraction injuries disrupting anterior constraints 
(anterior longitudinal ligament, intervertebral disc 
and body). 
� Rotation/translation injuries represent horizontal 
displacement of one cervical segment with respect to 
the other and are given  points. Translation injuries 
are noted to be present when any visible translation 
is not related to degenerative causes (e.g., unilateral 
or bilateral facet-fracture dislocations, “floating” 
lateral mass, pedicle fractures). Angulation ≥ ° 
in the axial plane is suggested as a threshold for 
presence of rotational injury. 
Integrity of the DLC represents a critical factor in 
treatment determination. It is best assessed on MRI, but 
it may be inferred on CT or plain radiographs. The DLC 
is comprised of the anterior and posterior longitudinal 
ligaments, the intervertebral disc, ligamentum flavum, 
interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and facet 
capsules. Indeterminate injuries to the DLC are assigned 
 point. These include injuries with isolated T signal 
change on MRI through posterior ligaments, or injuries 
with isolated interspinous splaying or widening. DLC 
disruption is assigned  points and is present with clear 
widening of the disc space or abnormal facet alignment. 
The neurological status of the patient is considered with 
the third category. Patients with a root level injury are 
assigned  point, whereas those with complete spinal 
cord and incomplete spinal cord injuries are assigned  
and  points, respectively. An additional point is added 
if significant compression is present in the presence 
of a neurologic deficit (e.g., congenital or spondylotic 
stenosis without overt fracture or ligamentous injury).

(T-L), and sacrum (S-, including coccyx) (refer 
to Figures -). Detailed descriptions for each 
classification are available online at the AO Spine 
website. Each classification evaluates the morphology 
of the injury, neurologic status, and patient-specific 
clinical modifiers. A surgical decision-making algorithm 
using the injury severity score exists to guide operative 
treatment., 
� For the upper cervical spine, injury morphology is 
divided into three categories: injuries to the occipital 
condyle and craniocervical junction, C ring and C
joint, C and Cjoint. � The subaxial cervical spine and the thoracolumbar 
classification both consist of  main categories (type 
A compression injuries, type B tension band injuries, 
and type C translation injuries) with the cervical 
classification containing two additional modifiers to 
describe bilateral (type BL) or facet injuries (type F). 
� Sacral injuries are morphologically categorized 
into three main categories: lower sacro-coccygeal 
fractures (type A), posterior pelvic injuries (type B), 
and spino-pelvic injuries (type C). 
� Neurologic injuries are described hierarchically, as 
follows: – N denotes patients that are neurologically intact, 
– N indicates a transient neurologic deficit, 
– N denotes a nerve root injury or radiculopathy, 
– N is an incomplete spinal cord injury or cauda 
equina injury, and 
– N indicates a complete spinal cord injury. 
– Nx is used when the neurological status is 
unknown (patient unable to be examined) and the 
plus sign (+) modifier is used to denote ongoing 
spinal cord compression. 
� Patient-specific clinical modifiers were designed to 
represent heterogeneity within spinal trauma and 
are denoted with M. These include variables that 
may significantly impact or change patient treatment 
(e.g., the presence of significant soft tissue damage, 
presence of a significant disc herniation in a cervical 
bilateral facet dislocation, or posterior tension band 
injury). Examples of patient facts that may affect 
treatment include the presence of significant medical 
comorbidities or bone metabolic disease such as 
ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal 
hyperostosis, or osteoporosis. Injury morphology grading includes the following: 
� Compression fractures (injuries of the anterior 
vertebral body with resultant kyphosis) are assigned 
 point. If the vertebral body fracture extends to the 
posterior vertebral body (traditional “burst” fracture), 
an additional point is given. 
� Rotational injuries are more severe and are best 
assessed on axial CT scans. Any horizontal 
separation of the spinous process or malalignment 
of pedicles above or below the injury is suggestive 
of rotational injury. Translation is readily assessed 
on sagittal or coronal imaging. Rotation/translation 
injuries imply torsional or shear forces on the spine 
and are assigned  points. 
� Distraction injuries are present when the cranial 
vertebral segment is circumferentially disrupted from 
the caudal segment, indicating significant spinal 
instability. They are assigned  points. 
The PLC in the TLICS consists of the supraspinous 
ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, 
and facet joint capsules. Disruption of the PLC is 
assigned  points and can be inferred with widening of 
the interspinous space, or facet joint diastasis, perching, 
or subluxation. Suspected/indeterminate PLC injuries 
are given  points. 
Evaluation of the neurologic status includes  point 
assigned for a root level injury,  points for a complete 
(motor and sensory) cord-level injury, and  points for 
an incomplete cord-level injury. In the lumbar spine, an 
evolving cauda equina injury is assigned  points. 
Patients with a combined score of  or less on the TLICS 
can be treated nonoperatively, but those with a total 
score ≥  can be treated operatively. Those with a score 
of  can be treated conservatively or operatively, based 
on the treating physician’s best judgment. AO Spine Trauma Classification 
The AO Spine Trauma Classification was developed 
to be comprehensive, easy to use, and address 
shortcomings of the SLIC and TLICS systems by 
including patient-specific characteristics.– Four 
separate classification systems for spinal trauma are 
defined, including the upper cervical spine (Occiput-C), 
subaxial cervical spine (C-), thoracolumbar spine

CLASSIFICATION 
KEY POINTS � To accurately assign an ASIA impairment grade, 
complete the assessment after the period in which 
spinal shock may occur. � After assessing sensation and motor function, the 
level of injury is defined as the lowest spinal segment 
with intact sensation and anti-gravity motor function 
preservation. Anatomical Considerations Acute SCI is classified descriptively, based on the level 
of injury and degree of function the patient exhibits 
on physical examination. Understanding the relevant 
functional anatomy and major subdivisions of the spinal 
cord is needed to correlate clinical findings with the 
location of the lesion. 
The gray matter of the spinal cord is located centrally 
in a butterfly or H shape as seen on a cross section. 
The gray matter has paired dorsal horns posteriorly 
and paired ventral horns anteriorly. The dorsal horns 
primarily constitute a sensory zone, which receives 
afferent fibers from the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. 
The ventral horns contain motor neurons and primarily 
constitute a motor zone. The white matter surrounding 
the gray matter is located in the periphery of the spinal 
cord. Its paired dorsal columns posteriorly are mostly 
a sensory zone. Its ventral columns anteriorly and 
lateral columns laterally include a mixture of sensory 
and motor zones. All columns include ascending and 
descending sensory and motor tracts or pathways.  
Table  details the function of selected ascending 
(sensory or afferent) and descending (motor or efferent) 
white matter pathways. Injury Classification Injury to the cervical spinal cord results in tetraplegia, 
with impaired function in the upper and lower 
extremities. Injury to the thoracic or distal spinal cord 
results in paraplegia, in which function of the upper 
extremities is preserved. Patients with an incomplete 
SCI have some residual function distal to the level of the 
injury, while those with complete SCI have permanent 
lack of function distal to the level of the injury. Incomplete Spinal Cord Syndromes Incomplete spinal cord syndromes refer to lesions 
involving certain structural and anatomic regions of 
the cord. They are usually associated with variable 
preservation of motor and sensory function below the 
level of injury, with no involvement of the head and neck. 
These lesions are often encountered following traumatic 
injuries, but they also result from other etiologies, e.g., 
tumors, infections, or systemic diseases. Incomplete SCI 
manifests with a constellation of physical impairments 
and can be categorized by several descriptive 
syndromes. 
Central Cord Syndrome. Central cord syndrome is the 
most common incomplete spinal cord injury, typically 
occurring after a fall with hyperextension injury to the 
cervical spine. Older adults with degenerative changes 
and spinal spondylosis are predisposed, and they are 
increasingly seen with this type of injury following a low

This syndrome’s constellation 
of symptoms is related to an injury to the intrathecal 
nerve roots distal to the conus that comprise the 
cauda equina. Incomplete cauda equina syndrome 
presents with bilateral sciatica, variable sensory and 
motor deficits in the lower extremities, which may be 
asymmetric. Complete cauda equina syndrome has 
these symptoms plus urinary and/or bowel retention or 
incontinence., Acute Phase Conditions Patients sustaining SCI often present with somatic 
dysfunction, including circulatory dysregulation 
from loss of sympathetic tone. Neurogenic shock is 
characterized by hypotension without compensatory 
tachycardia resulting from injury to the spinal cord’s 
autonomic pathways that lead to collapse of resting 
sympathetic tone and systemic vascular resistance. 
This constellation of findings can lead to end organ 
failure and death. Differentiate neurogenic shock 
from spinal shock, a loss of all spinal cord function and 
reflex activity. Spinal shock is characterized by flaccid 
areflexic paralysis, including loss of the bulbocavernosus 
reflex. Typically, acute spinal shock resolves within  
hours of injury. See section on Spinal Shock on page  
for more information. American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) 
Classification Use the ASIA classification of SCI to stratify the severity 
of the injury. To accurately assign an ASIA impairment 
grade, complete the assessment after the period in 
which spinal shock may occur. Refer to Table  for the 
ASIA classification descriptions. Refer to the Physical 
Examination section and Figure  on page  for 
documentation of the ASIA assessment.

In young patients, cord compression usually results 
from a fracture dislocation or herniation secondary to 
hyperflexion injury. Clinically, this syndrome manifests 
with prominent weakness in the upper extremities and 
less weakness in the lower extremities. Tendon reflexes 
are lost at the level of the spinal cord lesion. Bladder 
symptoms are rare, and when present, usually include 
urinary retention. Pain and temperature sensations 
are preserved above and below the level of the lesion. 
However, with disruption of crossing spinothalamic 
fibers in the ventral commissure, pain and temperature 
sensations may be absent at several adjacent 
dermatomes, creating the “suspended sensory level”. Anterior Cord Syndrome. This syndrome results from 
a vascular-type injury to the anterior spinal artery, the 
primary blood supply to the anterior spinal cord. The 
anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord is affected. This 
syndrome characteristically results in loss of motor 
function and pain and temperature sensation distal the 
level of the lesion; however, proprioception, vibratory 
sense, two-point discrimination, and fine touch are 
preserved. Posterior Cord Syndrome. This incomplete SCI, 
characterized by isolated loss of proprioception, is an 
extremely rare injury. Motor function, and all other 
sensory functions, are preserved. This pattern is due to 
the dorsal location of the proprioceptive tracts in the 
spinal cord. 
Brown-Sequard Syndrome. This syndrome can be 
caused by sharp hemi-transection of the spinal cord 
from blunt traumatic injury and cervical epidural 
hematoma. It has the best prognosis of all incomplete 
SCIs. This syndrome manifests as ipsilateral loss 
of motor function at the level of injury, as well as 
loss of dorsal column function (proprioception, 
vibratory sensation). Contralateral loss of pain and 
temperature sensation also occurs, which is related to 
the decussation of the spinothalamic tracts, typically 
occurring one to two levels below the level of the injury. 
Conus Medullaris Syndrome. Injury or compression to 
the distal aspect of the spinal cord, typically between 
T and L is the cause of this syndrome. It manifests 
with bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, 
loss of sensation around the perineum, and mild motor 
symptoms involving the lower extremities.

KEY POINTS � Occipital condyle fractures without neural 
compression or cranio-cervical misalignment can 
be managed successfully with a rigid or semi-rigid 
cervical orthosis. � Select treatment for cervical fractures on an 
individual basis, based on fracture type and patient 
factors, including age. � A best practice for stable thoracolumbar fractures 
without neurologic deficits is adequate pain control 
and early ambulation without a brace. Occipital Fractures Occipital condyle fractures (OCFs) are relatively 
uncommon, and they were rarely diagnosed until 
the widespread adoption of CT for trauma patients. 
OCFs were first classified by mechanism and fracture 
morphology: Type I (axial loading, comminuted, usually 
nondisplaced); Type II (direct trauma, linear, usually with 
concomitant skull base fractures); and Type III (rotation 
or lateral flexion, avulsion fragment, highest potential for 
ligamentous damage). Type I and II OCFs were deemed 
biomechanically stable, while Type III were potentially 
unstable. OCF reclassification incorporated ligamentous 
injury to better assess stability: Type I (nondisplaced 
fractures, either linear or comminuted); Type IIA 
(displaced fractures, without evidence of occipitoatlantal instability); and Type IIB (displaced fractures, 
with radiographic of ligamentous instability). 
Management guidance included: Type I OCFs do not 
require immobilization, Type IIA can be managed with 
a rigid cervical collar, and Type IIB require either halo 
immobilization or surgical fixation. Maserati et al. simplified these classification schemas 
by focusing on the criteria most essential in clinical 
decision-making. The presence of neural compression 
or cranio-cervical misalignment is an indication for 
surgical intervention. Other OCFs can be managed 
successfully with a rigid or semi-rigid cervical orthosis. 
While a halo device can be considered for rigid external 
immobilization with similar outcomes, particularly 
in the setting of bilateral OCFs, a cervical collar is 
recommended for improved patient comfort and 
compliance. However, the presence of cervical fractures 
or instability, as well as other sequelae of polytrauma, 
may influence the management of OCFs. 
Cervical Fractures Review the Spine Injury Classification section for the 
classifications and surgical indications for atlantoaxial and sub-axial cervical fractures. Similar to OCFs, 
management may be influenced by presence of other 
injuries. Without definitive evidence recommending any 
specific form of conservative management, treatment 
must be tailored individually, based on fracture type and 
patient factors. Atlas. Stable C fractures can be successfully managed 
nonoperatively., The utility of the various systems 
developed to classify atlas fractures lies in their 
guidance to assess the integrity of the transverse 
atlantal ligament, which is critical for C stability. Stable 
C fracture patterns include: 
� Fractures of the anterior arch alone (e.g., Gehweiler 
Type I); 
� Fractures of the posterior arch alone (e.g., Gehweiler 
Type II); 
� Minimally displaced burst fractures of both the 
anterior and posterior arches (unilateral or bilateral), 
without radiographic evidence of transverse ligament 
disruption (e.g., Gehweiler Type IIIa); 
� Minimally displaced fractures of the C lateral mass 
(e.g., Gehweiler Type IV); and 
� Isolated fractures of the C transverse process (e.g., 
Gehweiler Type V). 
These fractures are all best managed initially in a 
cervical collar. Surgery is often indicated for transverse 
ligament disruption, usually with displacement of the 
lateral masses greater than  mm, or other evidence of 
atlanto-occipital or atlanto-axial instability. 
Halo cervical traction for  to  weeks can be 
considered for unstable atlas fractures consisting of 
bony avulsion of the transverse ligament (e.g., Gehweiler 
Type IIIa). Surgery with modern operative techniques 
is recommended to stabilize these fractures. These 
fractures may eventually heal in a halo-vest, but the 
halo-vest is less commonly used because of its known 
risk profile (e.g., dysphagia, skin complications, and 
respiratory issues), especially for geriatric patients.NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT 
BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT The rationale for this bimodal approach is based on 
the high rate of nonunion in younger patients, and the 
morbidity with halo fixation in older adult patients., 
Studies report conflicting outcomes for both operative 
and nonoperative management of type II odontoid 
fractures in the older adult.Nevertheless, fibrous 
nonunion without radiographic instability may be an 
acceptable endpoint for these fractures among older 
adult patients, and this can be achieved with a cervical 
collar. Most cases of traumatic spondylolistheses of C 
(Hangman’s fractures) are managed operatively. 
However, isolated hairline fractures of the ring of the 
axis and those with minimal displacement (e.g., Effendi 
Type I & II) may be managed with external cervical 
immobilization, in either a cervical collar or a halo device 
depending on the severity of the fracture. Subaxial. Subaxial cervical spinal injuries can occur 
as compression failures of the anterior elements, 
tension band failures of the posterior elements, 
translation injuries, or facet injuries. Prior to considering 
nonoperative management, exclude indications for 
surgical intervention such as compression of neural 
elements or biomechanical instability. 
In selected patients consider deferring surgical 
management of stable non-displaced fractures of all 
types (e.g., isolated spinous and transverse process 
fractures, unilateral non-displaced facet fracture, 
minimally displaced facet fractures, and unilateral 
facet dislocations in the subaxial cervical spine without 
evidence of spinal cord injury), and manage them with 
immobilization in a rigid cervical orthosis. -. Observe 
and reassess these patients with dynamic cervical 
radiographs at  weeks (or a similar time-point). 
Thoracolumbar Fractures Similar to subaxial cervical spinal fractures, stable 
thoracolumbar fractures in patients without neurologic 
deficits can be safely managed nonoperatively, with 
acceptable outcomes in pain, employability, and residual 
deformity.Prolonged bedrest is not indicated for 
these patients and a best practice involves adequate 
pain control and early ambulation without a brace. 
For cases in which the C lateral mass is fractured and 
displaced (e.g., Gehweiler Type IV), closed reduction 
and halo-vest treatment for  to  weeks may be an 
acceptable alternative, especially in young patients. If 
the lateral mass can be realigned with ligamentotaxis, 
the risks of atlanto-axial fusion can be avoided. 
However, these patients need to be monitored closely 
with follow-up imaging (e.g., at , , and  weeks), 
to evaluate for joint incongruence that would require 
surgical fixation, and for posttraumatic arthritis that 
could indicate collapse of the joint., Axis. Fractures of C can occur in the odontoid process 
or in the vertebral body itself. Most of the kinetic 
energy to C is absorbed by the dens, and a number 
of classifications exist to organize C fractures on this 
basis. It is acceptable to manage all types of odontoid 
fracture initially with a cervical collar, followed by 
close observation and radiographic imaging to monitor 
for nonunion or malalignment., C vertebral body 
fractures (not Hangman’s fractures) that do not involve 
the dens are less common, but generally they are 
stable and best managed in a cervical collar. Shear 
fractures of the tip of the dens (e.g., Anderson D’Alonzo 
Type I) are usually stable, if they are not associated 
with occipito-cervical dislocation. A best practice 
is to manage these fractures in a cervical collar., 
Similarly, odontoid fractures extending into the C 
body (e.g., Anderson D’Alonzo Type III) can also heal 
with cervical immobilization. Although higher rates 
of fusion were observed with rigid immobilization in a 
halo device, use of a cervical collar is acceptable if risk 
factors for nonunion are not present (e.g., significant 
angulation, displacement of the dens more than  mm, 
comminution of the odontoid fragment, and advanced 
age)., 
Treatment options remain controversial for C fractures 
at the base of the dens, between the transverse ligament 
and the body of the axis (e.g., Anderson D’Alonzo Type 
II). If these fractures do not meet criteria for operative 
stabilization, recommendations are: � Initial management with external immobilization 
using a halo device in younger patients (less than  
years old) 
� A cervical collar in patients older than  years.

–. BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY PENETRATING SPINAL INJURY 
KEY POINTS � The vast majority of penetrating spinal cord level 
injuries result in complete (ASIA A) injuries. � Few gunshot injuries of the spinal cord require 
surgical stabilization. � Steroids are not recommended for penetrating spinal 
injury. No standardized pathway currently exists for the 
management of ballistic penetrating spinal cord injury 
(pSI), despite the rising prevalence of urban, civilian 
gun violence. Gunshot wounds (GSWs) are the third 
most common cause of spinal trauma after motor 
vehicle crashes and falls., The majority of civilian 
gunshot wounds are from relatively low muzzle velocity 
handguns. The mechanism for pSI is complex and 
involves higher energy transfer than occurs with blunt 
spinal injury. Thus, the overall prognosis for pSI is 
substantially worse than for blunt SCI.
Management of pSI in urban trauma centers is complex. 
These victims routinely have polytrauma, including 
multiple penetrating wounds, that takes precedence. 
Mechanisms of pSI generally result in less mechanical 
instability than blunt trauma. Overall, the strength of 
available data is relatively low, and most studies have 
relatively short follow up., 
Initial Assessment Initial assessment requires strict adherence to ATLS 
priorities. Radiographic and neurologic evaluation is 
often delayed as many patients are taken emergently 
to the OR for other injuries. When possible, perform a 
detailed neurologic exam and document it using ISNSCI 
criteria, including a rectal examination. Refer to  
Figure  on page . A CT scan of the neural axis, 
including vascular imaging for cervical injuries, is the 
primary imaging modality. Immobilization Some GSW victims arrive by police drop-off with no 
standard SMR protocols. Most victims that arrive by 
ambulance have standard SMR precautions, including 
backboards and cervical collars. However, collars can 
be removed to deal with airway and hemorrhage issues 
in cases of cervical penetrating injuries. Cervical collars 
can be continued for pain or concerns of instability. 
However, the majority of GSW injuries at any level of the 
spine do not require SMR.Surgical Indications The vast majority of cord level injuries from penetrating 
spinal trauma result in complete (ASIA A) injuries. 
Surgery does not appear to improve neurologic recovery 
for cervical and thoracic cord level injuries. Incomplete 
cord level injuries (ASIA B or above) are not common. 
Patients with these injuries can be considered for 
surgery if ongoing compression occurs, taking into 
account the higher risk of operative management that 
includes worsening neurologic status. In patients with 
neurologic deterioration and ongoing neural element 
compression, surgery may be indicated. While no 
high-quality data exists, neurologic improvement for 
incomplete cauda (lumbar) level injuries with ongoing 
compression from bullet/bone fragments in the canal is 
reported. Weigh the potential neurologic improvement 
against the considerable morbidity associated with 
surgical intervention. The surgical indications for neurologic issues are limited, 
and few GSW injuries require surgical stabilization; 
however, surgical stabilization occurs most often with 
cervical level injuries. No consensus exists regarding 
the classification of GSW bony injuries, and most often 
the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) is intact. 
Treating more severe cases with immobilization and 
serial imaging is a reasonable option, reserving surgical 
intervention for documented instability. Research does 
not support surgery to remove a bullet from the spinal 
canal for the following reasons: to prevent pain, to 
reduce infection risk even with transgression of a hollow 
viscus or airway, to prevent migration, or to prevent 
development of syrinx. Surgery may be indicated for

is extremely rare. If concerned, monitor the patient’s

removal of the fragment, if technically feasible. 
Medical Management 
Steroids are not indicated for pSI. Insufficient data 
exist to recommend blood pressure augmentation for 
pSI. With regard to antibiotic coverage, especially for 
projectiles crossing contaminated spaces, insufficient 
evidence exists to give guidelines, but the recommended 
range is from  to  days of antibiotic coverage., Role of MRI The role of MRI imaging in GSW injuries to the spine 
remains unresolved. While the vast majority of 
civilian ordinance is MRI compatible, partial steeljacketed ammunition is potentially an issue in the MRI. 
Radiologists are generally reluctant to allow MRI if the 
ballistic composition is unknown, especially when it is 
in proximity to vital structures. The one clinical scenario 
in which MRI is very useful occurs when the patient has 
a neurologic deficit without compression in the canal 
or a trajectory across the canal. MRI in these situations 
often shows concussive/blast like changes in the cord, 
and rules out other issues, such as epidural hematoma. 
Myelogram would be another option for these cases.Stab and Puncture Injuries to the Spinal Cord In the U.S., stab injuries occur less frequently than 
ballistic injuries. Surgical intervention may be 
considered for the following indications: removal of 
a retained foreign body, infection and sepsis, acute 
CSF fistula, hematoma formation, cord compression 
from a bony fragment or soft tissue, progressive 
neurological deterioration, and persistent chronic 
CSF leakage. Implement local wound debridement, 
tetanus prophylaxis, and a short course of prophylactic 
antibiotics to prevent meningitis or local infection.

TIMING OF SPINAL INTERVENTION 
KEY POINTS � Clinical judgment plays an important role 
in determining the optimal timing of spinal 
surgery in polytrauma patients to achieve early 
spinal stabilization while assuring the patient’s 
hemodynamic stability. 
� Resuscitation and positioning the patient on the 
operating room (OR) table must be planned to 
manage potential complications associated with 
other injuries. Early spinal cord decompression and stabilization for 
blunt SCI patients is recommended; however some 
delay in surgical stabilization may be required until 
cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic stabilization is 
achieved. It is essential to balance the need to optimize 
neurologic and systemic outcomes associated with 
early mobilization, while minimizing the morbidity and 
mortality associated with surgery on an inadequately 
resuscitated patient. Benefits of early mobilization 
include avoidance of pulmonary complications (e.g., 
adult respiratory distress syndrome), decubitus ulcers, 
contractures, and other complications. Regional 
anatomical considerations such as thoracic cage, aortic, 
cardiac, and pulmonary injuries, must be considered 
when treating patients with thoracic spine trauma. 
During discussions with trauma care providers, the 
intensivist, and the anesthesiologist review resuscitation 
endpoints to determine hemodynamic stability and 
readiness for surgery, e.g., base deficit, lactic acid levels, 
blood pressure, and volume status. While numerous retrospective and prospective studies 
have examined cohorts of SCI patients regarding the 
relationship between various cut-offs for surgical 
timing and outcome, very few studies delve into the 
details of polytrauma. It is highly likely that the severity 
of other injuries and co-morbidities play a role in 
patient selection for and timing of surgery when these 
factors are not controlled. No systematic large trial of 
randomized polytrauma patients examining different 
surgical timing by either spinal cord or spinal column 
injury, level of SCI, or patterns of polytrauma/ 
co-morbidities exists. As a result, clinical judgment 
plays an important role in determining the optimal 
timing of spinal surgery to effect surgical stabilization. One study using ACS Trauma Quality Improvement 
Program (TQIP) data, suggested that for patients 
without SCI, the optimal timing for spine stabilization 
surgery with the lowest rate of major complications 
occurred at  hours post-injury, reflecting the time 
necessary to stabilize patients. This study also reported 
that the risk of major complications increased after  
hours. These results can be extrapolated to some degree 
for patients with SCI. While early decompression of the 
spinal cord is important, SCI patients may experience 
worsening hemodynamic instability related to the 
spinal cord injury itself. A national Japanese study 
demonstrated no change in length of stay or in-hospital 
mortality in isolated cervical SCI patients treated less 
than  hours or between  hours and  days. A 
retrospective study of polytrauma patients with cervical 
or upper thoracic spinal column trauma concluded 
that major complication risk increased after  hours, 
even with logistic regression analyses accounting for 
factors including: generally older patients, higher body 
mass index (BMI), and lower likelihood of a spinal cord 
injury. One prospective cohort study in SCI patients 
demonstrated no differences between ultra-early  
(<  hours) and early (<  hours) surgery, consistent 
with the concept that it is important to take the time to 
ensure stabilization and proper pre-operative planning. A secure airway assuring adequate ventilation and 
respiration and cardiopulmonary stability is essential 
especially for patients who will be positioned in the 
prone or lateral decubitus positions for surgical therapy. 
For approaches involving the anterior cervical spine, 
airway security is a must, because the prepping and 
draping procedures may limit access to the airway. If 
the patient has a tracheostomy, take care to maintain 
sterility of the anterior neck when prepping and draping 
for an anterior cervical spine approach. Recognize that 
the presence of pulmonary contusions may result in 
progressive ventilation and respiration difficulties during 
surgery. This is an important consideration for patient 
positioning and OR table configuration selections. Use 
OR tables that allow for better thoracic excursion when 
lung injury is present and the prone position is required. CONCOMITANT INJURIES AFFECTING

E. Stabilization of circulating blood volume and blood 
pressure in the polytrauma patient with blood 
loss, or patients in neurogenic shock is also key to 
sustaining life, minimizing end-organ ischemia, and 
maintaining perfusion of the spinal cord to optimize 
outcome. Placing patients in the prone position to 
achieve posterior stabilization of the cervical, thoracic, 
or lumbosacral spine can increase risk for sudden 
decompensation and cardiac arrest upon turning. Thus, 
it is critical to ensure that the patient is stabilized with 
respect to heart rate and blood pressure. Also confirm 
no ongoing internal hemorrhage from solid organ or 
viscus injury, long bone fractures, or other injuries. 
While evidence is variable, it is generally well accepted 
that maintenance of spinal cord perfusion pressure is 
important, particularly early in the course by keeping 
mean arterial blood pressure at  to  mmHg to avoid 
hypotension (see below). 
Correction of coagulopathy must be performed preoperatively, especially for those patients undergoing 
large open incisions and dissections in which estimated 
blood loss (EBL) is anticipated to be significant. 
Consider the use of cell saver technology to autotransfuse operative blood loss, but do not plan for this 
to be the only mechanism of protection. Vigilance for 
ongoing and worsening coagulopathy in large surgeries 
from operative blood loss is also critical. If minimal EBL 
is anticipated, coagulopathy may be corrected preoperatively and intraoperatively. To avoid contamination, it is recommended that patients 
with open abdominal or viscus injuries be stabilized 
from a posterior approach. For posterior thoracolumbar 
or cervical stabilization approaches, take care when 
positioning these patients in the prone position to avoid 
compression of the abdomen. Carefully consider OR 
table configurations. Patients with severe TBI or blunt vascular injury are 
at risk for cerebral or spinal cord ischemia. Operative 
timing must be tailored to the general risk of progressive 
intracranial hypertension and tissue infarction. Further work is necessary to more closely define 
particular risk factors that should dictate the timing of 
spinal stabilization surgery in the polytrauma patient. CONCOMITANT INJURIES AFFECTING

PATIENT BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY NEUROGENIC SHOCK AND SYSTEMIC 
PRESSURE-DIRECTED THERAPY 
KEY POINTS � Injuries to the cervical and high thoracic spine cause 
vasoplegia and neurogenic shock due to a loss of 
sympathetic tone. � Avoid hypotension in patients with SCI. Weigh the 
decision to use mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals 
of mmHg for  days against the limitations 
of data, and the risk for utilizing vasopressors, 
prolonged immobilization, need for invasive 
monitoring, and the consumption of limited critical 
care resources. 
� An agent with both alphaand beta-adrenergic 
activity is recommended to treat both the 
hypotension and bradycardia associated with 
symptomatic denervation. The spinal cord is an end organ susceptible to secondary 
injury from hypoperfusion in the setting of trauma. 
Injury to the cervical and high thoracic cord result in 
sympathetic dysfunction with subsequent bradycardia 
and hypotension—neurogenic shock—putting the cord 
at further risk for hypoperfusion injury. 
In addition, the current recommendation is to maintain 
the MAP between  to  mmHg for a total of seven 
days after injury. This recommendation is based on two 
prospective cohort studies (Class III data) looking at 
a total of  patients with both cervical and thoracic 
injuries having the expected distribution of complete 
and incomplete injuries. These two studies and 
subsequent low-level studies demonstrate variable 
correlation. Additionally, only one time point ( days) 
was used in both prospective studies.
Reasonable agreement to avoid hypotension in the 
setting of SCI also comes from animal and clinical 
experience; however, the definition of hypotension 
is variable. Some report a blood pressure of / 
mmHg as the threshold for relative hypotension, which 
corresponds to a calculated MAP of  mmHg. The 
reported upper limit of normal blood pressure for 
younger patients is / mmHg, which corresponds 
to a calculated MAP of  mmHg. Therefore, it can be 
argued that MAP targets of mmHg represent 
normotension not augmentation. At least five clinical 
trials are ongoing or recently completed focused on 
MAP-directed therapy and/or spinal cord perfusion 
pressure (SCPP). Measurement of SCPP is based on 
lumbar drains or pressure monitoring catheters (SCPP = 
MAP minus intrathecal pressure). These study findings 
are not yet widely distributed., Avoid hypotension in SCI. The decision to use MAP 
goals of mmHg for  days has to be weighed 
against the limitations of the data, and the risks for 
vasopressor use, prolonged immobilization, invasive 
monitoring, and prolonged consumption of limited 
critical care resourses. The risks of using lumbar drains 
and/or intrathecal catheters to lower the intrathecal 
pressure and increase perfusion pressure across the 
neuraxis include CSF leak, infection, and catheter 
placement complications. 
Treatment of hypotension due to neurogenic shock 
following SCI initially includes volume resuscitation, 
taking care to avoid volume overload. This is followed by 
vasopressors as needed. No consensus exists regarding 
the best vasoactive agent; however, an agent with both 
alphaand beta-adrenergic activity is recommended to 
treat both hypotension and bradycardia associated with 
sympathetic denervation.

KEY POINTS � The use of methylprednisolone within  hours 
following SCI cannot be definitively recommended. � No other potential therapeutic agents have yet 
demonstrated efficacy for motor recovery and 
neuroprotection. To date, no definitively proven successful pharmacologic 
therapy is available to mitigate SCI. The trials for the 
National Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS) were 
conducted in the ’s and ’s.,,, These studies 
identified a subgroup of patients who demonstrated 
better motor scores after receiving methylprednisolone 
within  hours of injury compared with placebo. 
This was further supported by a Cochrane review.  
Unfortunately, studies also demonstrated side effects 
that included infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, 
hyperglycemia and death. 
National and international associations have 
split on their recommendations for the use of 
methylprednisolone. The use of methylprednisolone 
within  hours following SCI cannot be definitively 
recommended. Its use needs to be balanced against the 
known potential complications on an individual basis.  
Studies of other potential therapeutic agents, including 
GM ganglioside, minocycline, thyrotropin-releasing 
hormone, nimodipin, gacylidine (GK-), riluzole, and 
granulocyte colony stimulating factor, among others, 
have either failed to demonstrate efficacy for motor 
recovery and neuroprotection, or are being studied in 
ongoing clinical trials.,,, References .

PROPHYLAXIS 
KEY POINTS � Initiate chemoprophylaxis as early as medically 
possible, typically within  hours of injury, to reduce 
the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). � Determine the duration of chemoprophylaxis 
on an individual patient basis considering injury 
severity, mobility status, bleeding risk, and other comorbidities. 
� Surveillance duplex ultrasound for VTE in 
asymptomatic patients is not recommended, but it 
can be considered in high-risk patients who cannot 
have chemoprophylaxis during the acute period. SCI patients have an elevated risk of developing VTE, 
with a typical incidence ranging between  percent 
to  percent.The risk of both deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in SCI patients 
increases with age, concomitant long-bone injuries, 
personal history of prior VTE, and higher degrees of 
spinal cord injury (e.g., ASIA A), among others.The 
risk is highest during the acute period, with most VTE 
typically developing between  hours and  weeks 
of injury, and the risk tapers at  months post-injury. 
Patients with SCI also have a higher risk for chronic VTE 
for at least -year post-injury, and this is associated with 
a  to  percent mortality rate due to PE alone., No standard guidelines currently exist for 
chemoprophylaxis initiation in SCI patients. Numerous 
studies report patients with SCI have a significantly 
higher rate of developing symptomatic VTE when not 
started on mechanical prophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis 
in the acute period of injury.A best practice is to 
start chemoprophylaxis as early as medically possible, 
typically within  hours of injury, to reduce the risk of 
VTE. Initiate mechanical prophylaxis (e.g., sequential 
or pneumatic compression devices and compression 
stockings) immediately after the injury, if able, especially 
for patients with bleeding risk or other contraindications 
for chemoprophylaxis. Evaluate patients on a case-bycase basis regarding initiation of these therapies, taking 
into account the risks associated with them, such as 
bleeding or lower extremity fractures. 
No one chemoprophylaxis agent is definitively superior 
for SCI patients; however, a recent meta-analysis 
found that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was 
better than unfractionated heparin for DVT and VTE 
prevention in adult trauma patients. Low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) is the most extensively 
studied, and it safely reduces VTE incidence without 
significantly increasing bleeding complications.
For patients with traumatic SCI requiring surgical 
intervention, no significant increased post-operative 
complications occurred when LMWH was initiated 
within the acute period after surgery.-,,However, 
full anticoagulation is reported to increase the bleeding 
risk acutely after injury, and no benefit was reported 
over prophylactic dosing.Recent studies suggested 
increased efficacy when using direct oral anticoagulants 
(DOACs), especially in orthopaedic populations or 
for prophylaxis in rehabilitation facilities; however, 
insufficient data in SCI populations exist at this time to 
warrant further recommendations.Insufficient evidence exists to support a standard 
duration of treatment. Typically, courses are continued 
during SCI rehabilitation placement, but often do not 
extend past the three-month interval, regardless of 
motor function. The risk of VTE trends toward the 
general population average risk the further a patient is 
from the initial injury.-, It is recommended that 
providers determine the duration of chemoprophylaxis 
on an individual patient basis considering injury severity, 
mobility status, bleeding risk, and other co-morbidities. 
Surveillance duplex ultrasound for VTE in asymptomatic 
patients is currently not recommended. It is neither 
sensitive nor specific in this population, and no 
evidence exists that it decreases the rates, morbidity, 
or mortality of VTE in asymptomatic SCI patients.
Studies using surveillance ultrasound screening 
upon patient admission to rehabilitation facilities 
detected DVTs in  to  percent of SCI patients, 
however, most of these studies had either low rates 
of chemoprophylaxis adherence or excluded patients 
receiving chemoprophylaxis., For high risk patients 
who cannot have chemoprophylaxis initiated within  
hours, consider using duplex imaging to exclude DVTs 
until adequate therapy can begin.

BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY SPINAL SHOCK 
KEY POINTS � Spinal shock is a total or near-total areflexia with the 
complete loss or suppression of motor function and 
sensation distal to the anatomical lesion. � Spinal shock can persist from days to weeks, and it 
can be prolonged due to toxic or septic syndromes. � The end of spinal shock for most patients is seen 
with the early return of the deep plantar reflex 
and with the bulbocavernosus, cremasteric, ankle 
jerk, Babinski sign, and knee jerk recovering in a 
progressive order. Spinal shock refers to the sudden and transient 
depression of neural function below the level of an acute 
spinal cord lesion after injury. The term is often a source 
of confusion for providers, frequently applied incorrectly 
to describe hypovolemic shock and/or neurogenic 
shock, leading to the risk of patient mismanagement. 
Spinal shock causes a temporary or permanent, 
complete or near-complete segmental interruption of 
neurotransmission. It is seen as a total or near-total 
areflexia, as well as the complete loss or suppression of 
motor function and sensation distal to the anatomical 
lesion. Assumptions on the extent of injury based on 
physical exam during spinal shock are unreliable. Do not 
delay emergent, decompressive interventions. 
Spinal shock following SCI is associated with a high 
energy fracture-dislocation, ligamentous injury, and 
rotational distraction. It is most common in men ( 
percent) and the young (average age  years). Major 
mechanisms of injury associated with spinal shock 
include motor vehicle crashes ( percent), and SCI 
associated with domestic injuries or falls ( percent). 
Controversy exists regarding the association of spinal 
shock with patient prognosis; however, the magnitude of 
spinal shock is proportional to the severity and rapidity 
of anatomic injury. 
� The temporal evolution of SCI with spinal shock is 
well described from animal model studies. 
� Initially hemorrhage and protein extravasation are 
seen at the spinal level of direct injury. � By four hours, central hemorrhagic necrosis is 
present in the entire central gray matter and the 
adjacent white matter. 
� By  hours, the central gray matter and most of the 
white matter are necrotic. � Edema of the spinal cord peaks by day three to six, 
and it may persist for up to two weeks. 
� Two months following injury, only the outer rim of 
white matter is present. 
� By one to two years, cavitary healing occurs with the 
resorption of necrotic debris and autolysis due to 
lysosomal accumulation. 
For less severe injuries, the surrounding white matter, 
with associated long neuronal tracts, may be preserved, 
potentially leading to an incomplete injury pattern. 
Rapidly enacted interventions for preservation (e.g., 
decompression and stabilization) are needed to avoid 
secondary injury related to hypoxemia or hypotension. The loss of reflex function is common at the spinal 
cord level associated with direct injury. However, the 
more distal the origin of the cord reflex is from the site 
of injury, the higher the likelihood for preservation. 
Some patients with high cervical cord injuries are 
reported to retain distal sacral reflexes, specifically 
the bulbocavernosus and the anal wink. Do not 
confuse these spared reflexes with the sacral sparing 
associated with a partial SCI. Patients with spinal shock 
and a complete SCI lack sacral sensation. Reflexes 
immediately cranial to the injury may also become 
depressed because of the loss of ascending, distal cord 
influence. 
Spinal shock can persist from days to weeks, and it can 
be prolonged due to toxic or septic syndromes. During 
the recovery period, neuronal healing, collateralization, 
and reorganization may occur. With the SCI-related lack 
of supraspinal inhibition, the re-innervation of posterior 
root axons can lead to spastic muscle spindle reflexes. 
Reflexive muscle spasticity does not indicate the end 
of spinal shock, it indicates the reorganization of local 
reflex arcs. 
A lack of consensus exists to define the end of spinal 
shock. Providers may interpret the end of spinal shock 
from one of the following: 
� The appearance of the bulbocavernosus reflex, 
occurring within several days of injury, 
� The return of deep tendon reflexes which can take 
several weeks, 
� The return of reflexive bladder function. 
SPINAL SHOCK 
BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY SPINAL SHOCK Common to most patients is the early return of the deep 
plantar reflex with the bulbocavernosus, cremasteric, 
ankle jerk, Babinski sign, and knee jerk recovering in 
a progressive order. Cutaneous reflexes often recover 
before deep tendon reflexes, rather than a caudal to 
cranial presentation favored by some authors. During 
the  to  week period following injury, most patients 
see significant bladder and vasovagal response recovery. 
However, spinal cord areas with permanent damage may 
never have the return of their associated reflexes. As 
patients progress, optimizing the presence or absence of 
reflex arcs becomes one focus for rehabilitation services.

BRADYCARDIA 
KEY POINTS � Sinus bradycardia is the most common dysrhythmia 
occurring during the acute phase following spinal 
cord injury. 
� Cardiovascular instability is often precipitated by 
suctioning, turning, and hypoxia. � Treatment of persistent bradycardia or intermittent 
episodes of severe bradycardia may include a beta
adrenergic agonist (albuterol), chronotropic agents 
(atropine, epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine), 
or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (aminophylline, 
theophylline). Cardiovascular abnormalities commonly occur 
during the acute stage of SCI at level Tor higher. 
Hypotension (both supine and orthostatic), cardiac 
dysrhythmias (primarily bradycardia) and autonomic 
dysreflexia are due to the SCI-associated disequilibrium 
between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous 
systems. Cardiac sympathetic preganglionic neurons 
exit the spinal cord from T to T while parasympathetic 
neurons reach the heart via the recurrent laryngeal 
and vagus nerves.,, The SCI-associated disruption in 
descendent sympathetic tracts results in unopposed 
parasympathetic tone.The patient’s inability to 
vasoconstrict the vascular beds in the viscera and 
extremities leads to blood pooling, impaired venous 
return, and low cardiac output resulting in hypotension. 
The degree of sympathetic cardiovascular dysfunction 
is directly related to the location and severity of SCI. A 
post-mortem examination of human spinal cord tissue 
revealed that individuals with more severe hypotension, 
bradycardia, and autonomic dysreflexia in the acute 
stage following injury had more extensive areas of 
degeneration within the spinal cord white matter. 
Loss of sympathetic control can lead to a low resting 
blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, loss of 
diurnal fluctuation of blood pressure, and increased 
susceptibility to cardiac dysrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia 
is the most common dysrhythmia in the acute stage 
following SCI; however, other cardiac irregularities are 
attributed to SCI, including repolarization changes, 
atrioventricular blocks, supraventricular tachycardia, 
ventricular tachycardia, and primary cardiac arrest.
Cardiovascular instability is often precipitated by 
tracheal stimulation (suctioning), turning, and hypoxia. 
Most cardiovascular changes are observed in the acute 
phase, ranging from immediately after injury to  weeks 
post injury.,, Initial management of SCI must ensure adequate 
blood pressure with fluid resuscitation and the use of 
vasopressors with both alphaand beta-adrenergic 
actions (norepinephrine). Persistent bradycardia or 
intermittent episodes of severe bradycardia can be 
treated with a betaadrenergic agonist (albuterol), 
chronotropic agents (atropine, epinephrine, dopamine, 
norepinephrine) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
(aminophylline, theophylline).Rarely, patients 
with medication-resistant bradycardia may benefit 
from pacemaker insertion; however, this is associated 
with a  to  percent device complication rate.In 
a retrospective study of patients with cervical SCIinduced bradycardia, enteral albuterol reduced the 
frequency of symptomatic bradycardia and resulted 
in less rescue therapy using chronotropic agents 
or need for pacemaker insertion. Enteral albuterol 
has a rapid onset of action ( minutes), and peak 
plasma concentrations are achieved within  hours. 
Duration is  to  hours with a half-life of . to  
hours. For treatment of orthostatic hypotension, the 
alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, midodrine, is 
recommended., References .

HIGH SPINAL CORD INJURY 
KEY POINTS � Early tracheostomy is recommended to aid in 
mechanical ventilation during the acute and more 
chronic phases of care for patients with SCI. � Consider stimulation of the diaphragm in highSCI patients in order to plan long-term ventilator 
strategies and determine a patient’s potential to 
wean from the ventilator. Care of patients with high SCI (at or above C) 
is complicated by the following physiologic 
changes: decreased or absent respiratory drive, low 
pulmonary volumes, weak or absent cough, weak and 
uncoordinated respiratory muscle function (including 
diaphragm), and chest wall rigidity. Additionally, global 
immobility leads to potential dysfunction related to 
pulmonary emboli. Patients with injuries at lower 
C-Spine levels may also have significant respiratory 
dysfunction due to loss of chest wall innervation and 
poor or absent cough. This constellation of problems 
makes weaning from the ventilator very difficult without 
innovative strategies. Complicating patient management 
further is autonomic dysfunction, resulting in increased 
secretions, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, and 
disordered breathing during sleep. The propensity for 
these issues to contribute to atelectasis and pneumonia 
can further complicate ventilator management. Early 
tracheostomy is recommended to aid in mechanical 
ventilation during the acute and more chronic phases 
of care (Refer to section on Placement of Tracheostomy 
Following Cervical Stabilization on page ). The main goals of patient management include 
restoration and maintenance of lung volumes that 
cannot be achieved spontaneously. These goals can 
be accomplished in a variety of ways, e.g., continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP), intermittent positive 
pressure breathing (IPPB) generally later in the course, 
or specific ventilator modes such as airway pressure 
release ventilation (APRV) in cases of severe atelectasis. 
Later in the course, the use of assisted coughing, 
insufflation, breath stacking, and glossopharyngeal 
breathing can be used, many of which can be achieved 
non-invasively. Additional therapeutics potentially 
beneficial include mucolytics and beta agonists that 
help to attenuate the reflexive bronchoconstriction and 
increased mucous production in this patient population. Approaches by Cervical Injury Level Injuries at the C to C level cause diaphragmatic 
paralysis, generally resulting in permanent ventilator 
dependence. However, some patients are able to use 
self-ventilatory techniques for brief periods. 
Patients with C to C injuries experience 
diaphragmatic dysfunction, but they may have partial 
ventilatory function. However, these patients have 
reduced tidal volumes and vital capacity. Longer periods 
off of mechanical ventilation may be possible, and some 
patients can achieve mechanical ventilation only at 
night. These patients also have the potential for noninvasive ventilatory techniques at home, especially while 
upright. 
Regardless of injury level, techniques to help SCI 
patients become ventilator-free for at least some time 
include therapies such as optimization of pulmonary 
toilet and medications, high volume ventilation, and 
non-invasive ventilation. Diaphragm pacing is beneficial 
for the patient in these ways: � Helps improve respiratory mechanics (specifically 
spontaneous tidal volume), 
� Reduces weaning time and achieves independence 
from the ventilator, and 
� Potentially decreases hospital cost and length of 
stay., 
Consider stimulation of the diaphragm in the highSCI patient to plan long-term ventilator strategies. An 
inability to stimulate the diaphragm supports a future 
inability to wean from ventilation. References .

FOLLOWING CERVICAL STABILIZATION 
KEY POINTS � Tracheostomy can be performed early after anterior 
cervical spinal stabilization without increasing the 
risk of infection or other wound complications. � Open and percutaneous tracheostomy are both safe 
techniques. Early tracheostomy after cervical SCI improves 
outcomes, reduces morbidity and mortality, and 
improves hospital length of stay,especially with higher 
cord levels when prolonged ventilation is anticipated. 
Published reports variably define early tracheostomy as 
less than seven days, less than four days, and  to  days 
post-injury. Admission ASIA motor score can be used to 
predict the need for subsequent tracheostomy. 
Anterior cervical stabilization is often required for 
unstable spinal column injuries and injuries that result 
in anterior spinal cord compression. Of concern is the 
proximity of the required incision for spinal stabilization 
to that of a midline tracheostomy incision. The potential 
for wound infection or dehiscence of the stabilization 
incision is particularly worrisome with secretions 
from tracheostomy site potentially contaminating the 
incision. The potential complication of esophageal injury 
during anterior spinal procedures has implications for 
deep infection impacting the tracheal tissues as well. 
Evidence exists that early tracheostomy can be 
performed safely,, after anterior cervical spinal 
stabilization without significantly increasing the risk 
of infection or other wound complications.,Safe 
techniques include both open and percutaneous 
tracheostomy. Consider performing tracheostomy early 
(within days) of SCI, even in the setting of an anterior 
cervical spinal stabilization procedure. Additionally, do 
not alter the standard of care for airway management 
when timing the cervical surgery. References .

FOLLOWING CERVICAL STABILIZATION BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY ANALGESIA IN SPINAL CORD INJURY 
Refer to the ACS TQIP Best Practices Guidelines for Acute 
Pain Management in Trauma Patients KEY POINTS � Pain management is a priority in the care of the 
acutely injured SCI patient to relieve suffering and to 
prevent dysautonomia symptoms triggered by pain. � Implement a multimodal approach for the acute pain 
management of patients with SCI. Patients with SCI experience various types of pain 
including nocioceptive somatic, nocioceptive visceral, 
and neuropathic pain., Patients experience pain 
above, at, and below the level of the lesion, and it 
is often experienced in areas where sensation is 
altered or absent. Both hyperesthesia and allodynia 
(pain experienced in response to non-painful stimuli) 
symptoms are described. Nociceptive somatic pain may 
be caused by spinal column injury from destruction and 
damage to bone, muscle, tendon, and other soft tissues, 
expansile hematoma, and other local tissue trauma. 
Following hemodynamic stabilization, the provision of 
comfort and pain management becomes a priority in 
the care of the acutely injured SCI patient. In addition to 
suffering from the pain, dysautonomia symptoms can 
occur in response to pain in the SCI patient. 
Self-reported pain assessment of the SCI patient with 
critical injuries can be challenging because of paralysis 
that impedes gestures and the presence of intubation 
or tracheostomy that impedes speech. Pain assessment 
tools recommended for the non-verbal patient in the 
ICU include both the Critical Care Pain Observation 
Tool and the Behavioral Pain Score., However, both of 
these tools rely on observation of movement or muscle 
tension which cannot be used when motor, muscle 
tone, and/or sensory function are altered. Health care 
providers need to rely on other assessment parameters 
such as facial grimacing, blinking in response to 
questions, or patient proxy (family) report of subtle 
communication methods. Vital signs remain unreliable 
indicators for pain assessment, especially in the setting 
of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. 
When the patient is able to self-report, perform a 
comprehensive pain assessment using measures that 
address neuropathic pain. It is important to perform a home medication 
reconciliation at the earliest opportunity after 
admission, especially for patients with pre-existing 
psychiatric/psychological disorders. It is essential 
to assess for a history of substance abuse (drugs 
and alcohol), as well as pre-morbid chronic pain. 
Consider consulting with chaplaincy or mental health 
professionals early in the patient’s hospitalization to 
help the patient cope with depression and loss. The multimodal approach to pain management is 
recommended in the acute pain management of 
SCI patients. Initial pain regimens may include a 
combination of opiates, acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents., Although the 
literature is mixed regarding the impact of NSAID use on 
union/nonunion, there is support for its use in the acute 
post-operative phase. Chronic long-term use may have 
detrimental effects on bone healing. However, several 
pre-clinical studies in animal models report that NSAID 
use may be protective against inflammatory processes 
after SCI. 
For neuropathic pain, anticonvulsants (gabapentinoids, 
such as gabapentin and pregabalin) and antidepressants 
(tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline 
or novel antidepressants) are recommended over 
other modalities., Knowledge of the side effects 
and prescribing nuances of these medications is 
critical. Longer-term management of neuropathic 
pain may include novel strategies such as spinal cord 
stimulation. It is essential to remember that the inability to perceive 
sensation and pain may result in occult problems (e.g., 
intestinal ischemia, cholecystitis, bladder spasm, etc.). 
Maintain vigilance in the examination of the abdomen, 
and aggressively work-up unexplained signs of infection

SYMPTOMS OF SPINAL CORD INJURY 
KEY POINTS � Treat acute autonomic dysreflexia by sitting 
the patient upright, removing tight-fitting 
garments, correcting the inciting stimulus, and if 
needed, administering quick onset, short-acting 
antihypertensives to reduce blood pressure. � Spasticity is managed with physical therapy, and in 
some cases, anti-spasticity medications. � Use clinical judgment and a validated assessment 
tool to assess skin breakdown risks, and prevent 
decubitus ulcers by avoiding known modifiable risk 
factors such as pressure, shear force, and moisture to 
the skin. 
Injury to the spinal cord can generate a number of 
medical complications, including dysautonomia, muscle 
spasm and spasticity, and decubitus ulcer or pressure 
injury. While these complications may first occur 
during acute hospitalization or rehabilitation, they often 
remain problematic for the patient throughout their life. 
Prevention, early recognition, and timely treatment of 
these complications are essential to optimize patient 
outcomes. Upon hospital or rehabilitation discharge 
educate patients and their caregivers on the cause, 
prevention, and appropriate interventions when one of 
these potential complications occur. 
Autonomic Dysreflexia Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) or autonomic hyperreflexia 
can occur in both complete and incomplete SCI, 
usually above level T. The condition consists of an 
uninhibited sympathetic response to a precipitating 
physiologic stimulus below the level of the spinal cord 
lesion, e.g., bladder distension, pressure sores, occult 
fractures, or bowel impaction. Sympathetic hyperactivity 
causes vasoconstriction below the spinal cord lesion, 
leading to a dramatic rise in blood pressure, followed 
by a compensatory parasympathetic response that 
causes vasodilation above the injury with or without 
bradycardia., AD manifests most commonly as 
headache, diaphoresis, flushing, anxiety, nausea, and 
nasal congestion. If not treated, hypertension can cause 
potentially life-threatening stroke, seizures, myocardial 
infarction, or pulmonary edema. Treatment of acute 
AD consists of reducing the blood pressure by sitting 
the patient upright, followed by removal of tight-fitting 
garments, and correction of the inciting stimulus (most 
commonly fecal impaction or an obstructed indwelling 
urinary catheter). If hypertension persists despite 
nonpharmacologic interventions, administer a shortacting antihypertensive (e.g., nifedipine, captopril) with 
quick onset. Prevention of AD is focused on avoiding 
potential precipitants. 
Spasticity Spasticity is an upper motor neuron syndrome that 
occurs after SCI, resulting in hyperexcitability of the 
tonic stretch reflex, which manifests as increased 
muscle tone in response to passive stretch. Spasticity 
can worsen quality of life by impairing activities of daily 
living and causing pain, immobility, and muscle spasms. 
It is important to note that symptoms of spasticity 
may also be beneficial by enhancing stability for 
sitting, standing, dressing, and transfers. Management 
must carefully strike a balance to optimize functional 
outcome. With the combination of immobility and 
spasticity, muscles resting in a shortened position 
for prolonged periods can form contractures, due to 
reorganization of the collagen matrix., 
Physical therapy is a mainstay of treatment. 
Strengthening exercises, postural management, 
manual stretching, and orthoses are treatments used to 
maintain range of motion and prevent contractures. 
Although rehabilitation is the first-line management 
of spasticity, anti-spasticity medications are often 
prescribed to patients with SCI, despite limited efficacy 
in clinical trials. Consider pharmacologic agents as 
an adjunct in patients with debilitating spasticity, 
despite physical therapy interventions. Patients have an 
individualized response to each medication, so the ideal 
regimen is often determined empirically. Baclofen, an 
agonist in the GABAergic system, is the most commonly 
used agent. If effective, it is administered orally or 
injected intrathecally long-term using an implantable 
infusion pump. Baclofen reportedly helps most with 
flexor spasms. Monitor patients with implanted pumps 
for signs of withdrawal due to pump failure, a clinical 
emergency. AVOIDANCE OF ASSOCIATED 
SYMPTOMS OF SPINAL CORD INJURY BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY improve hyperactive reflexes and painful spasms, and 
dantrolene can augment range of motion. 
Refer to Table  for oral pharmacologic agents used 
for treatment of spasticity after SCI. Other studied 
pharmacologic options include cannabinoids, injection 
of botulinum toxin, and chemical neurolysis/denervation 
of peripheral nerves. 
Other agents include tizanidine, an alpha-adrenergic 
agonist; benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, clonazepam); 
and dantrolene, which inhibits calcium release in the 
muscle itself. None have demonstrated significant 
efficacy in terms of improvement in functional measures 
or ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs).

pressure injury development., Prompt transfer to 
a specialty referral center accustomed to managing 
patients with acute traumatic SCI was found to reduce 
the incidence of pressure injuries., 
Decubitus ulcers can compromise patient outcomes, 
including delayed surgery or transfer to rehabilitation, 
prolonged bedrest, increased hospital length of stay and 
costs, need for additional surgical interventions, hospital 
readmission, triggered autonomic dysreflexia, decreased 
functional outcome, and reduced quality of life and selfesteem.,Deterioration of decubitus ulcers can lead 
to infection, sepsis, and death., 
Assessment and Prevention. Assess the patient’s 
skin thoroughly and regularly for evidence of pressure 
injury. Clinical judgment and a validated risk assessment 
tool are recommended to assess risks for skin 
breakdown,, such as the Braden Scale,, Norton 
Scale,, or the Spinal Cord Injury Pressure Ulcer 
Scale (SCIPUS).No consensus exists regarding the 
best tool or frequency of risk assessment. Identifying 
the patient’s pressure injury risk factors guides the 
implementation of targeted preventative interventions. 
Prevent decubitus ulcers by avoiding known modifiable 
risk factors including pressure, shear force and moisture 
to the skin. 
� Protect the patient from prolonged contact with 
unpadded surfaces and remove the patient from the 
backboard as soon as possible., 
� Switch the cervical collar to one that is well-padded if 
it must remain in place. 
� Ensure linen and padding near the patient is dry. 
Keep tubes, folds in the bedding and other nonessential firm medical devices from beneath the 
patient. 
� Use pressure redistribution surfaces (e.g., specialty 
mattress or bed, seat cushion, heel protectors, and 
padding beneath the elbows and between the knees 
when turned) to protect boney prominences and 
soft tissues from injury. When selecting a mattress 
for a patient with an unstable spinal injury, consult 
the vendor to ensure it is acceptable for use with a 
patient who has an unstable vertebral column injury. 
� Mobilize the patient as soon as possible. 
� Use a lift or lift sheet to avoid friction and shear on 
the patient’s skin when moving or turning the patient. 
Decubitus Ulcer Decubitus ulcers are a common complication in patients 
with acute SCI. A reported incidence of pressure 
injuries during acute hospitalization ranges from  to 
 percent.The prevalence noted upon admission 
to rehabilitation is as high as . percent.,, Up 
to  percent of patients reported having a stage II 
or higher pressure injury in the year following SCI. 
Diseases of the skin are the second leading cause 
for hospital readmission in the first year after SCI. 
Acquisition of a pressure injury during SCI acute 
hospitalization is a predictor for readmission to acute 
care from rehabilitation. Boney prominences are at 
high risk for pressure injuries and common anatomic 
locations for decubiti include the sacrum, coccyx, ischial 
tuberosities, trochanters, elbows, heels, ankles, knees 
and occiput.,, 
Risk Factors. Factors that put the patient with SCI at 
risk for development of pressure injuries include lack 
of sensation, loss of motor function, spasticity, edema, 
slowed capillary refill, fecal and urine incontinence, 
collagen changes and reduced muscle mass.,, 
Additional risk factors include the possibility of hypoxia, 
hypotension, and acidosis. Hypotension was found to be 
the strongest predictor of pressure injury development. 
Patients with complete SCIs, particularly in the cervical 
region, are at greater risk for pressure ulcers.,,, 
Older adults with SCI often have more friable skin, poor 
peripheral perfusion and decline in collagen, normal 
elastin, and muscle mass, making skin breakdown more 
likely., The presence of co-morbidities, e.g., diabetes, 
pulmonary or vascular disease, can increase risk of 
decubiti. Pulmonary complications and urinary tract 
infections (UTI) are also associated with increased 
risk for pressure injuries in patients with SCI.,, 
Patients who are malnourished or have a history of 
pressure injuries also are at higher risk following 
SCI. Psychological, social and cognitive issues, such 
as depression, anxiety, impaired cognition, lack of 
motivation, substance abuse, lack of knowledge, and 
non-compliance may also make development of decubiti 
more likely.,, 
Interventions used to treat SCI also place the patient 
at risk, including devices such as backboards, cervical 
collars, other braces and splints, nasogastric and 
endotracheal tubes, fecal management systems, and 
oxygen tubing.,, Prolonged immobilization while

the wound including any dressing needed. Antibiotics 
may be prescribed if an infection is associated with the 
wound. Electrical stimulation may be used to enhance 
closure of stage III or IV pressure injuries.,, If 
nonsurgical interventions prove ineffective, surgical 
wound debridement and coverage may be necessary. 
Educate the patient with SCI and their family about the 
risk for decubitus ulcers and preventative interventions 
to use. Teach the importance of good skin care and 
regular skin self-assessments. Education and patient 
encouragement to take responsibility for skin care 
and pressure ulcer prevention needs to be reinforced 
throughout the patient’s life.

in the leg and back elevation (e.g., high back 
wheelchair)., 
� Regularly perform pressure relief maneuvers (e.g.,

facilitate patient mobilization and proper positioning. 
� Provide good skin hygiene. 
� Make sure any brace or splint fits well. Provide 
good skin care beneath the device; checking for any 
redness or skin breakdown each time the brace or 
splint is removed. Ensure the skin is dried well after 
cleaning, and any padding or liner is clean and dry 
before reapplying. 
Care of systemic factors that put the patient at 
risk for decubitus ulcers is vital. Ensure sufficient 
blood pressure and systemic oxygenation. Initiate 
interventions to reduce orthostatic hypotension prior 
to sitting the patient up and getting the patient out of 
bed. Implement a bowel and bladder management plan 
that keeps stool and urine away from the skin to reduce 
risk for skin breakdown. Promote good nutrition to 
foster maintenance of skin integrity, and consider a 
dietitian consultation to help determine the appropriate 
nutritional intake. 
Management. At first sign of skin breakdown relieve 
pressure at the site. Minimize time a patient is 
positioned on the area of skin injury, and use support 
surfaces and positioning practices to avoid pressure 
on the decubitus ulcer. Consult with a wound 
ostomy continence nurse to obtain input on solutions 
for pressure, friction, and moisture reduction, and 
treatment of skin breakdown. Devise and implement 
an interdisciplinary plan for managing the patient’s skin 
and any decubitus ulcer. This plan typically includes

ACUTE CARE MANAGEMENT 
KEY POINTS � Initiate a bowel management program for all patients 
with acute spinal cord injury. � The goal of effective bladder management is 
to preserve upper urinary tract structures and 
minimize urinary tract infections. Customize bladder 
management after acute spinal cord injury to the 
individual, weighing potential benefits and risks, such 
as fluid status, comorbid injuries and conditions, and 
personal preferences. Neurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction are highly 
prevalent following traumatic SCI. Early and effective 
management of neurogenic bowel and bladder 
symptoms helps reduce the incidence of secondary 
complications including autonomic dysreflexia, skin 
breakdown, ileus, and UTI. Neurogenic Bowel Management In the first few days after acute SCI, patients are at 
risk for ileus because the gut wall is hypotonic and 
unresponsive to stimuli. Colonic transit time is severely 
prolonged during the initial weeks post injury, and more 
than  percent of individuals with SCI experience some 
degree of bowel dysfunction.The most commonly 
reported symptoms of neurogenic bowel dysfunction 
include constipation ( to  percent), fecal 
incontinence ( to  percent), abdominal distension 
or discomfort ( to  percent), and the need for digital 
stimulation or manual disimpaction ( percent).,,
Symptoms of neurogenic bowel dysfunction are more 
severe in individuals with complete SCI compared with 
incomplete SCI. Constipation due to neurogenic bowel 
dysfunction can contribute to autonomic dysreflexia 
when SCI is at or above T.,Increased external anal sphincter tone and increased 
rectal tone and contractility can result from injuries 
above the S level and lead to reflex defecation.
Injuries at or below the S level can cause reduced 
external anal sphincter tone and reduced rectal tone 
and contractility, leading to fecal impaction and 
incontinence.The physiological terms reflexic 
and areflexic bowel are commonly used to classify 
neurogenic bowel dysfunction. However, individuals 
with injuries above S may show no sign of reflexic 
bowel function, while others with injuries at the conus 
medullaris or cauda equina may demonstrate some 
residual reflexic bowel function. 
A bowel management program is indicated for all 
individuals with acute SCI who do not require surgical 
intervention (e.g., ostomy), either because of neurogenic 
bowel dysfunction severity or secondary complications. 
Bowel management for individuals with reflexic and 
areflexic neurogenic bowel dysfunction includes diet 
and fluid management, oral medications (e.g., stool 
softeners, laxatives, prokinetic agents, and rectal 
medications), and assisted defecation by means of 
manual disimpaction and/or positioning. Mechanical 
rectal stimulation with digital stimulation and rectal 
stimulants such as suppository or mini-enemas may 
be useful for individuals with reflexic neurogenic bowel 
dysfunction. Goals of bowel management include: 
� Passing stool daily or every other day, 
� Moderate to large amounts of soft, formed, bulky 
stool and complete emptying of the rectal vault, 
� Bowel evacuation at a consistent time of day, and 
� Completion of bowel care in less than 
minutes. 
Surgical diversion via colostomy or ileostomy may be 
required for severe neurogenic bowel dysfunction and/ or severe skin breakdown in the perineal or perirectal 
regions. Neurogenic Bladder Management Most patients with traumatic SCI have impaired 
micturition and voiding due to neurogenic bladder 
dysfunction, which can lead to upper and lower urinary 
tract complications. The overall goal of effective bladder 
management is to preserve the upper urinary tract 
structures and minimize lower tract complications. During an initial period of spinal shock, detrusor 
areflexia occurs and the bladder has no contractions, 
resulting in overflow incontinence. Recovery of skeletal 
muscle reflexes, which may occur after  to  weeks, 
leads to gradual recovery of uninhibited bladder 
contractions for individuals with injuries above the S 
level. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, intermittent or 
complete failure of external urinary sphincter relaxation

problem that prevents complete bladder emptying 
in suprasacral SCI., High intravesical pressures 
due to prolonged bladder contractions may cause 
hydronephrosis and renal deterioration. Impaired 
detrusor contractility may continue for patients 
with injuries at S or below. These individuals may 
experience progressively decreased bladder compliance, 
resulting in increased intravesical pressure with filling 
that can contribute to upper tract deterioration over 
time. Indwelling catheterization is commonly used for 
initial bladder management to monitor urinary output 
when maintaining fluid balance is essential. Urethral 
catheterization is most commonly used initially. 
Suprapubic catheter placement is considered as the 
initial bladder management method for individuals 
with known or suspected urethral abnormalities, such 
as stricture, false passages, bladder neck obstruction 
or urethral fistula, perineal skin breakdown, or the 
presence of prostatitis, urethritis, or epididymo-orchitis. 
Suprapubic catheter placement can be performed under 
local anesthesia; however, consider general or spinal 
anesthesia to manage autonomic dysreflexia while 
distending the bladder for safe catheter placement. Intermittent catheterization is recommended as the 
optimal bladder management method once precise 
urinary output measurement is no longer necessary. 
Intermittent catheterization is performed  to  times 
every  hours, but it can vary depending on oral fluid 
intake. Avoid bladder distension and bladder volumes 
greater than  mL to reduce the risk for UTI. 
Intermittent catheterization may not be feasible for 
individuals with abnormal urethral anatomy, cognitive 
impairment, inability to adhere to a catheterization 
schedule, persistently high fluid intake, or a tendency 
to develop autonomic dysreflexia with bladder filling 
despite catheterization. UTI and urethral trauma are the most frequent 
complications related to intermittent catheterization. 
However, the overall incidence of UTI, bladder stones, 
poor bladder compliance, upper tract deterioration, 
and urethral erosions is higher in patients treated 
with indwelling catheters compared with intermittent 
catheterization for bladder management. When 
indwelling catheterization is indicated beyond the acute

ACUTE CARE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY MOBILIZATION AND REHABILITATION 
FOR ACUTE TRAUMATIC SPINAL  
CORD INJURY 
This section was prepared with participation from 
the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine’s 
(ACRM) Spinal Cord Injury Interdisciplinary Special 
Interest Group. 
KEY POINTS � Begin physical and occupational therapy treatment 
for patients with acute SCI within the first week after 
injury once medical readiness is determined, even if 
patients remain on some level of sedation, vasoactive 
support, or mechanical ventilation. � Provide holistic early education to patients and 
caregivers to help them monitor for adverse events, 
participate in their recovery, and plan for future care. 
� Discharge patients with an acute SCI to a 
comprehensive acute inpatient rehabilitation facility 
with expertise in SCI when possible. Early mobility and initiation of physical and occupational 
therapy within the intensive care unit (ICU) is 
demonstrated to be beneficial to patients with acute 
traumatic SCI.Implementing an early mobility 
program is safe, well tolerated, and cost effective; and it 
has the benefit of decreasing delirium days, increasing 
ventilator-free days, improving functional outcomes, 
and increasing the rate of direct discharge to home., 
Adverse events during early physical and occupational 
therapy are addressed in many studies. While a risk 
for dislodging essential lines and tubes exists (e.g., 
peripheral IVs, central lines, urinary catheters and 
endotracheal tubes), these events occurred in a small 
percentage of cases and can be avoided when proper 
clinical judgment and trained staff are used. , However, 
limited evidence exists regarding the ideal timing for 
initiating physical and occupational therapy for patients 
who experience an acute SCI. 
Mobilization Early mobility, driven by bedside nursing, are all passive 
interventions focused on passive range of motion, 
repositioning in bed, and lateral transfers to stretchers 
for transport or cardiac chairs for upright positioning., 
Consultation with a physical medicine and rehabilitation 
(PMR) physician, physical, occupational, and speech 
therapy early in a patient’s hospital course is essential to 
optimize participation in active interventions. 
Therapists must identify and follow medical parameters 
for management prior to implementing bedside 
physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Medical 
complexities (e.g., varying hemodynamics, lines and 
tubes, utilization of braces, and medical devices) can 
be perceived as barriers to implementation of bedside 
therapy, but communication and coordination within the 
multidisciplinary team can overcome these barriers and 
ensure success.,,When physical and occupational 
therapy do not have an established role within the ICU, 
studies report and support the value for implementing 
these quality improvement programs in the ICU.,,, It is recommended that physical and occupational 
therapy begin treatment for patients with acute SCI 
within the first week after injury once medical readiness 
is determined, even if patients remain on some 
level of sedation, vasoactive support, or mechanical 
ventilation. No studies directly examine the timing 
and effectiveness of initiating physical, occupational, 
and speech therapy in acute SCI, but delays in initiating 
rehabilitation can prolong return to independence in 
ADLs and negatively impact quality of life outcomes.
The goal of implementing rehabilitation early within 
the hospital stay is to reduce secondary complications, 
improve functional outcomes, improve patient 
independence in mobility and ADLs, and help minimize 
psychosocial distress resulting from injury., Physical, occupational, and speech therapy evaluations 
consist of a thorough review of the presenting injury, 
past medical history, and hospital events. During the 
initial evaluation, therapists perform a systems-review 
examination to identify physical impairments. Goals 
and realistic outcomes are then developed based on the 
patient’s needs. The realistic outcomes are then used 
to provide patients with a reasonable understanding of 
their prognosis based on injury level, ASIA classification, 
medical comorbidities, motivation, and family support. 
Once impairments are determined, therapists develop 
a plan of care that includes the frequency of treatment 
and interventions to meet the identified goals. Limited 
evidence exists about interventions and therapy 
dosage that produce the best outcomes. Rehabilitation 
taxonomies help guide therapists to determine ideal 
interventions and their frequency.MOBILIZATION AND REHABILITATION FOR 
ACUTE TRAUMATIC SPINAL CORD INJURY BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: SPINE INJURY � Provide the following to all patients: pressure 
relief schedules with assistance as needed, ROM, 
strengthening, and consideration for splinting. � Be diligent in monitoring the skin for pressure injury 
because the rate is high in the acute phase. Educate 
patients and families to report signs of pressure 
injury if utilizing upright sitting schedules or bracing/ splinting. 
� Anticipate that patients will experience an abnormal 
hemodynamic response to position change during 
initial therapy sessions. Progressive head-of-bed 
elevation and using lower extremity and abdominal 
compression may help prevent this. 
A best practice is to provide holistic early education to 
patients and caregivers enabling them to monitor for 
adverse events, participate in their recovery, and plan for 
future changes including discharge planning from acute 
care. 
Categories of intervention for physical and occupational 
therapy include: range of motion (ROM)/stretching, 
strengthening, bed mobility, balance, upright tolerance, 
endurance, transfer training, wheelchair mobility, seating 
prescription, skin management, wound care/edema 
management, equipment prescription, airway clearance, 
splinting, and patient/family education.,Categories 
of speech therapy intervention include: functional and 
augmentative communication, swallowing management, 
and cognitive/language deficits. Use these categories 
of interventions, as well as expected long-term 
functional outcomes to determine which interventions 
to initiate and prioritize within the acute care 
environment. Refer to Table  for long-term functional 
outcomes for specific injury levels. Medical complexities often complicate the progress of 
therapy in the acute care environment. Prepare and plan 
for intervention modifications.,

 Dec ; (): –. Rehabilitation Discharge from acute care to an inpatient rehabilitation 
facility, rather than a skilled nursing facility improves 
long-term outcomes, functional independence, 
quality of life, and reduces long-term morbidity., 
Ideally, patients with acute SCI are discharged to a 
comprehensive acute inpatient rehabilitation facility 
with expertise in SCI. Medical factors that may preclude 
discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility include: 
limited oral intake, reliance on  total parenteral nutrition 
(TPN), extensive wounds, persistent requirement 
for mechanical ventilation, or multi-limb involved 
polytrauma. Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACH) 
may be most appropriate for initial rehabilitation in 
this situation, with eventual transfer to an inpatient 
rehabilitation facility. A best practice is to connect 
patients/caregivers with a practitioner or liaison within 
an inpatient rehab facility, to facilitate transfer or to 
guide provision of an appropriate level of care when 
the patient is medically ready. Even though inpatient 
rehabilitation facilities may be scarce, advocate for 
patients with acute SCI who would benefit the most 
from these services., 
Peer-to-peer support initiatives have been implemented 
in the acute hospital, inpatient rehabilitation and 
community settings for decades. While little empirical 
evidence exists about the benefit of these programs on 
physical health, it is believed they have psychological 
and social benefit to patients, their family members 
and peers themselves.Peer support for trauma 
patients during acute hospitalization reduces depression 
and rehospitalizations.Peer mentors can also 
be a valuable source of information and education 
for clinicians working in settings where SCI is not 
common. The Trauma Survivors Network program of 
the American Trauma Society provides resources for 
developing a peer support initiative as part of integrated 
care within trauma centers.,

INJURY BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES 
KEY POINTS � The trauma medical director, trauma program 
manager, trauma liaisons, registrars, and staff have 
a leadership role in implementing the ACS TQIP 
Spine Injury Best Practices Guidelines, supporting care 
of the patient with SCI, and monitoring guideline 
compliance. � A stakeholder workgroup, receiving its directives 
from the trauma medical director and the trauma 
operations committee, implements the spine injury 
management BPG. 
� The workgroup reviews the ACS TQIP Spine Injury 
Best Practices Guidelines and completes a gap analysis 
related to the current spine care in the trauma center. 
Implementing trauma center best practices guidelines 
begins with the trauma medical director (TMD), 
trauma program manager (TPM), the trauma 
liaisons, and registrars as leaders and change agents. 
These individuals are responsible for the oversight, 
management, and continuous commitment to improving 
care within the trauma center and the trauma system, 
regardless of level of trauma center designation. These 
leaders define the leadership structure, culture, and 
implementation processes for the BPG that fosters 
stakeholder engagement. This process includes the 
following: 
� The spine practice guideline interdisciplinary 
workgroup, with a defined leader and reporting 
structure, is charged with reviewing the spine 
guideline and determining the need to complete a 
gap analysis that compares current practice to the 
recommended BPG. � An educational plan is developed for the 
implementation of the spine management guidelines 
and sustaining of the new practices. � Documentation is integrated into the electronic 
medical record (EMR) to facilitate reporting 
consistency and to track outcomes. The spine injury management guideline workgroup 
is charged with comparing current practice to those 
recommended in the BPG to identify gaps. This gap 
analysis identifies opportunities to align the trauma 
center’s spine management practices with the ACS TQIP 
Spine Injury Best Practices Guidelines. Trauma centers that 
serve as a referral center for spine injuries may choose 
to not complete the full gap analysis, but to review the 
guideline recommendations for potential opportunities. 
The workgroup, in conjunction with the trauma center’s 
operations committee, establishes the priorities for 
changes. Progress reports regarding the completion 
of these identified tasks are provided to the trauma 
operations committee. Refer to Table  for examples of 
gap assessment tools.

current structure and processes of the PIPS plan. 
The interdisciplinary workgroup defines and 
recommends key elements of the ACS TQIP Spine Injury 
Best Practices Guidelines for integration into the trauma 
performance improvement processes. After approval 
of these key elements from the trauma operations 
committee, they are integrated, reviewed, addressed, 
and reported through the structure and processes 
of the Trauma PIPS Plan. These trauma performance 
improvement recommendations are applicable to the 
facility’s trauma activations and trauma admissions 
with spine injury. This includes any direct admits for 
the trauma or spine service. Please refer to Table  
for Spine Injury Management Guideline Performance 
Improvement Recommendations. 
Regional System Integration 
A regional system may choose to develop a regional 
collaborative to review and coordinate spine injury 
care across the region. This collaborative initiative is 
interdisciplinary and needs to include rehabilitation 
services, and psychosocial services. The spinal injury 
collaborative defines its priorities and focus, which 
may require regional data related to spine injury and 
outcomes. Potential priorities for development of 
regional spine injury guidelines include a focus on the 
following: � Pre-hospital care, field triage, and destination, 
requiring trauma center data sharing related to spine 
injury outcomes � Early access to rehabilitation, requiring the region to 
identify the various levels of rehabilitation services 
available and the services they provide. 
� Identifying community psychological and peer-topeer support for the patients with spine injury.

It occurs when the axons of nerves running through the spinal cord are disrupted, leading to loss of motor and sensory function below the level of injury. Injury is usually the result of major trauma, and primary injury is often irreversible.[] These injuries are particularly costly and disabling as they disproportionately affect patients under -years-old, lead to significant functional impairment for the remainder of the individual’s life, and put the individual at risk for numerous complications leading to increased morbidity and mortality. [] SCI is estimated to have a lifetime economic impact of  to  billion dollars.[][] Etiology Within the United States, the leading cause of spinal cord injury is motor vehicle collisions, constituting % of new SCI each year. % are due to falls, % due to violence, % from sports injuries, and % from medical and surgical etiologies.[] Epidemiology Globally, between , and , patients, each year suffer a spinal cord injury. Most of these cases are due to preventable causes such as violence and motor vehicle accidents. In the United States, there are approximately , new cases of SCI each year, and roughly , Author Information and Affiliations persons are estimated to be living with SCI.[] Males represent the majority of patients with SCI related to a sports injury. The age group with the highest risk of SCI is from  to  years of age. Pathophysiology Spinal cord injuries are most often due to either direct trauma to the spinal cord or from compression due to fractured vertebrae or masses such as epidural hematomas or abscesses. Less commonly, the spinal cord may become injured due to compromise of blood flow, inflammatory processes, metabolic derangements, or exposure to toxins. Primary Injury  
SCI results from initial insult such as mechanical forces to it, which is known as the primary injury. The most common mechanism of primary injury is a direct impact, and persistent compression typically occurs by bony fragments through fracture-dislocation injuries. Contrary to fracture-dislocation, hyperextension injuries usually result in less frequent, impact alone plus transient compression. The third mechanism, distraction injury, a stretch and tear of the spinal cord in its axial plane, occur by pulling apart of two adjacent vertebrae. Lastly, laceration/transection injury, which arises through sharp bone fragments, severe dislocations, and missile injuries.[] Secondary Injury Secondary injury is a series of biological phenomena that begins within minutes and continue to self-immolation for weeks or months following the initial primary injury.  The acute phase of secondary injury begins after SCI and involves vascular damage, ionic imbalances, free-radical formation, the initial inflammatory response, and neurotransmitter accumulation (excitotoxicity). The subacute phase follows, which includes demyelination of surviving axons, Wallerian degeneration, matrix remodeling, and formation of the glial scar.[] Immune Response Spinal Cord Injury Neuroinflammation can be either beneficial or detrimental following SCI, providing time-point and the state of immune cells. The first three days following SCI, inflammatory events involve recruiting blood-born neutrophils resident microglia and astrocytes to the injury site. The second phase, approximately three days post-injury, enrolls macrophages, Band T-lymphocytes to the injury site. CD+ helper T  become activated by antigen-presenting cells and release cytokines that subsequently stimulate B cell to synthesize and release antibodies, which exacerbate neuroinflammation and subsequent tissue destruction. Neuroinflammation is more robust in the acute phase of SCI. Ongoing inflammation may persist in subacute and chronic phases, even for the rest of a patient's life. Inflammatory cell composition and phenotype alter according to the stage of inflammation and the signals existing in the injury microenvironment. T cells, B cells, and microglia/macrophages are capable of gaining either pro-inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory pro-regenerative phenotype.[] Disruption of nerve axons running through spinal cord tracts leads to loss of motor and sensory function below the level of injury. Patterns of disability are dependent on the level of the injury and which spinal tracts are affected.[][] 
Spinothalamic tracts run within the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. These nerve axons carry sensory information for pain and temperature. Damage to these tracts leads to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation. Corticospinal tracts run within the lateral aspects of the spinal cord. These nerve axons control motor function. Damage to these tracts leads to ipsilateral weakness or paralysis. In the cervical spine, axons leading to the upper extremities are located close to the center of the spinal cord. In contrast, axons leading to the lower extremities are located on the periphery. The dorsal columns run within the posterior aspect of the spinal cord. These tracts carry information for tactile, proprioceptive, and vibratory sensation. Damage to these tracts leads to contralateral loss of tactile, proprioceptive, and vibratory sensation. History and Physical Typically patients will present after a significant traumatic event such as a motor vehicle accident, fall from a height, or gunshot wound. Vitals are unlikely to be abnormal, although high cervical injuries can result in hypotension and bradycardia due to loss of sympathetic tone. The physical exam will reveal weakness and sensory deficits correlating to the pattern of injury, and the spinal tracts affected. Several classic patterns of injury are well described.[][][] 
Complete Transection of the Spinal Cord [] These injuries typically demonstrate complete bilateral loss of motor function, pain sensation, temperature sensation, proprioception, vibratory sensation, and tactile sensation below the level of injury. Lumbosacral injuries will present with paralysis and loss of sensation in the lower extremities. These injuries may also result in loss of bowel control, loss of bladder control, and sexual dysfunction. Thoracic injuries lead to the same deficits as lumbosacral injuries and, in addition, may result in loss of function of the muscles of the torso, leading to difficulty maintaining posture. Cervical injuries lead to the same deficits as thoracic injuries and, also, may result in loss of function of the upper extremities leading to tetraplegia. Injuries above C may also cause respiratory compromise due to loss of innervation of the diaphragm. Central Cord Syndrome This is the most common incomplete SCI. Injury is caused by hyperextension of the neck leading to compression of the cervical spinal cord, causing damage primarily to the center of the cord. This pattern of injury leads to weakness affecting the upper extremities more so than the lower extremities. This pattern occurs as the corticospinal tracts are arranged with those axons supplying the upper extremities located closer to the center of the spinal cord, while those supplying the lower extremities are closer to the periphery. There may also be an associated loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of injury. Anterior Cord Syndrome Classically due to compromise of blood flow from the anterior spinal artery. Bilateral injury to the spinothalamic tracts leads to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of injury. Bilateral injury to corticospinal tracts leads to weakness or paralysis below the level of injury. As dorsal columns are unaffected, tactile sensation, proprioception, and vibratory sensation remain intact. Posterior Cord Syndrome This injury pattern rarely occurs due to trauma. More often, injury is due to infectious, toxic, or metabolic causes. Damage to dorsal columns causes loss of tactile sensation, proprioception, and vibratory sensation. As spinothalamic and corticospinal tracts are unaffected, there is the preservation of pain sensation, temperature sensation, and motor function. Brown-Séquard Syndrome [] Injury results from right or left-sided hemisection of the spinal cord. Transection of the corticospinal and dorsal column nerve tracts leads to ipsilateral loss of motor function, tactile sensation, proprioception, and vibratory sensation below the level of injury. Transection of the spinothalamic tract leads to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of injury. Conus medullaris Syndrome It is caused by injury to the terminal aspect of the spinal cord, just proximal to the cauda equina. It characteristically presents with loss of sacral nerve root functions. Loss of Achilles tendon reflexes, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction may be observable. Neurogenic Shock [][] It results from high cervical injuries affecting the cervical ganglia, which leads to a loss of sympathetic tone. Loss of sympathetic tone results in a shock state characterized by hypotension and bradycardia. Evaluation As spinal cord injuries most often occur in the context of significant trauma, a comprehensive physical examination and clinical assessment for concurrent injuries are necessary at the time of presentation. Recognition of the above injury patterns can help localize the location and type of injury suffered. Clinical examination with a detailed and accurate examination of motor and sensory nerves is essential for classification. 
SCI is graded using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale. The grading system varies based on the severity of injury from letters A to E.[] . ASIA A: Complete injury with loss of motor and sensory function. . ASIA B: Incomplete injury with preserved sensory function, but complete loss of motor function. . ASIA C: Incomplete injury with preserved motor function below the injury level, less than half these muscles have MRC (Medical Research Council) grade  strength. . ASIA D: Incomplete injury with preserved motor function below the injury level, at least half these muscles have MRC (Medical Research Council) grade  strength. . ASIA E: Normal motor and sensory examination. 
Imaging is vital to identify the injuries accurately. Plain radiographs have been used traditionally, however with advancing technology and poor sensitivity with plain radiographs, computerized tomography (CT or CAT scan) has been replaced as the initial screen to identify bony abnormalities like fractures. CT can reveal vertebral fractures and raise suspicion for SCI; however, it has very poor sensitivity for soft tissue injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to accurately assess the level of injury to the spinal cord itself.[][] MRI can help with prognostication, and several clinical scores use this to predict prognosis.[] Early spinal cord injury findings see on an MRI include spinal cord compression, spinal cord contusion, spinal cord edema, spinal cord transection, spinal cord hemorrhage, and ligamentum flavum bulging.[] Subacute findings include spinal cord edema, subacute progressive ascending myelopathy, and syrinx.[] 
Other associated imaging findings may include:[] Traumatic disc herniation: Seen with vertebral disc dislocations and hyperextension injuries. Nucleus pulpous herniation and annulus fibrosus herniation are seen in this condition. Epidural hematoma Pseudomeningoceles Extradural fluid collections Vascular injuries of arteries like the carotid artery, vertebral artery, etc., Vertebral fractures Treatment / Management Treatment begins at the site of injury and paramedics, and emergency medical services staff can play a significant role in stabilization before transfer to the hospital. Immobilization can help prevent the worsening of any existing injuries. In the case of serious trauma, address any life threats or concurrent traumatic injuries immediately. Hypotension and shock will worsen the impact of any existing SCI and worsen the likelihood of neurologic recovery. Immediate measures are necessary to maintain breathing and hemodynamic stability. Surgical decompression may be warranted if feasible to lessen the extent of the injury. [][][] This procedure helps to stabilize the spine, to prevent pain, reduce deformity, deliver compression from a herniated disc, blood clot, or foreign body. 
Patients with SCI are best managed in neurological intensive care units with expertise in managing such patients. Dedicated trauma units must be identified and designated to transfer and care for these patients. 
Rehabilitation is an integral part of healing, and these patients have the best possible outcomes with intense rehabilitation therapy under the guidance of physiatrists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Rehabilitation is to be continued on an outpatient basis once the patient is ready for discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Several medications have had trials to help with improving outcomes in SCI, but the results have not shown significant benefits. Trials with nimodipine, gacyclidine, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, riluzole, gangliosides, minocycline, magnesium, acidic fibroblast growth factor have been studied to see their impact on improvement in patients with SCI.[][][][][][] [] At the current time, further research is necessary with regards to these agents, and high dose steroids are the mainstay for acute treatment of SCI. Differential Diagnosis The diagnosis of spinal cord injury will likely be relatively precise based on the patient’s presentation, which will probably be following a major traumatic event.[] However, when the time of onset and preceding events are less clear, a broader differential for motor and sensory deficits should be considered. Central Nervous System Pathologies Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) Postictal (Todd) paralysis Hemiplegic migraine Multiple sclerosis Peripheral Nerve Pathologies Guillain-Barré syndrome Transverse myelitis Tick paralysis Neuromuscular Junction Pathologies Myasthenia gravis Organophosphate toxicity Botulism Other Pathologies Hypoglycemia Hypokalemic periodic paralysis Hypocalcemia Diabetic neuropathy Conversion disorder Prognosis The prognosis for patients with spinal cord injury is very poor. Unfortunately, there is no definite treatment leading to recovery for SCI. Less than % of patients with SCI recover complete function before the time of hospital discharge. The level of disability suffered directly correlates to the level of injury, with higher-level injuries resulting in more significant disability and higher complication rates. Patients will SCI suffer significantly increased mortality in the first year following injury, and those that survive still have decreased life expectancy. Only % go on to hold employment, and less than one half will get married.[] Complications Spinal cord injuries are associated with numerous complications such as urinary tract infections, pressure sores, deep vein thromboses, autonomic dysreflexia, and chronic pain. Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in individuals with SCI at or above thoracic spinal level  (T). This condition often manifests as orthostatic hypotension. The symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are often challenging to treat. Symptomatic management with abdominal binders, elastic stockings, peripheral vasoconstrictor medications like midodrine, and mineralocorticoids like fludrocortisone can help. Increased salt intake can also help with volume expansion and help with symptom control. There are also significant indirect costs through lost mobility, inability to work, and heavy caregiver burden.[][] 
The most common causes of mortality are pneumonia and sepsis.[] Deterrence and Patient Education Spinal cord injury is very stressful and overwhelming for the patient and the families. Patient education must be an important part of the clinical management of patients with this condition. Counseling is necessary regarding prognosis, complications, and outcomes. Support groups can help with the management of issues like anxiety, frustration, loneliness, and depression. The patient should receive counsel about the diagnosis and the prognosis. Prevention centers can help with mitigating factors leading to traumatic injuries like improvement in motor vehicle safety, gun control, and social programs aimed at the prevention of violence. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes . . Once a patient has suffered spinal cord injury, their quality of life and life expectancy is dependent upon continued well-coordinated care between an interprofessional healthcare team. A team approach is ideal for helping mitigate the many complications that can result from SCI [] []: Evaluation by a neurosurgeon at the time of injury can help minimize the extent of the initial injury. Nursing care can prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections, pressure sores, and aspiration pneumonia from occurring. Physical and occupational therapists can help maximize the patient’s level of function. Social workers can coordinate disability services and reimbursements. A psychiatrist should be available to help the patient with depression, which is common following SCI.[] Pain management specialists can help manage ongoing issues with chronic pain.

Postgrad Med J ;:–. doi: ./pgmj.. Injury of the spinal cord has been known since antiquity. There is no cure for the injury and until modern times patients died rapidly from a combination of pressure sores and urinary tract infection. Treatment consists of preventing complications until the spine has stabilised and the patient can be rehabilitated to an independent life. This article explores how this treatment developed in the ancient world, the middle ages, in Europe, Great Britain, and latterly in the United States.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . T raumatic injuries to the spinal cord do not occur in isolation. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and cord injury is usually the result of an injury to the vertebral column such as a fracture or a dislocation. This bony injury impinges upon the spinal cord. The immediate consequences are damage to the nerve fibres with exudation of fluid. If the axons are completely transected no recovery will occur. If they are not completely severed then as the swelling recedes, over a period of weeks, months or even years, some recovery of the damaged axons may occur. At present there is no cure and treatment consists of carrying out all measures, to prevent further damage to the cord by undue movement and then realignment of the vertebra either by surgery or postural reduction. It may be that in the future with the development of stem cell transplantation and pharmacological agents the damage to the cord can be reduced and the spinal cord repaired. The results of a cord injury are loss of motor power, loss of sensation and paralysis of the bowel and bladder. All efforts are concentrated on preventing secondary complications from this loss of function—that is, pressure sores due to the loss of feeling, and ascending infection of the kidneys from the paralysed bladder. This treatment was developed as a result of the pioneering work at the end of the th century by Theodor Kocher in Switzerland and Wilhelm Wagner in Germany, in  by Donald Munro in the United States, and in  by Ludwig Guttmann in the United Kingdom. This paper is a review the development of this treatment. CLASSICAL TIMES In Egypt, paraplegia due to injury of the spine was first described in the Edwin Smith surgical papyrus in Egypt about 
BC. After the decline of the Egyptian Empire there are records from Hippocrates (circa – BC) who was the first to describe traction to reduce these injuries. This was followed by Paul of Aegina (AD –), who used a windlass to reduce the dislocation and recommended laminectomy. Manual extension was recommended for the treatment of a fractured spine. The fall of the Roman Empire led to an almost total abolition of the practice of medicine in Western Europe. Greek and Roman traditions were preserved in the Eastern Empire and in the Arabian Empire by Christian, Jewish, and Moslem physicians. Avicenna (–) followed the teachings of Paul of Aegina and maintained that a fracture of the body of the vertebra was fatal when accompanied by paralysis (fig ). PRE-RENAISSANCE In Europe before the Renaissance, medical schools associated with the universities were gradually re-established, the first at Salerno, where Roland of Parma (circa ) studied. He used manual extension for the treatment of fractured spines and was the first to emphasise one of the keystones of modern practice: the necessity for early treatment. POST-RENAISSANCE Ambroise Pare´ (–) recommended laminectomy for spinal injury. TH CENTURY United Kingdom In the United Kingdom with the development of the London teaching hospitals two prominent surgeons, Astley Cooper (–) and Charles Bell (–), were interested in the treatment of spinal injuries. Cooper described in detail the clinical manifestations of spinal injury and recorded that his teacher, Henry Cline (–), had performed the first laminectomy for this condition. Bell was an outstanding neurologist, artist, physician, and surgeon, was opposed to laminectomy, and indulged in a celebrated controversy with Cooper on the subject. Bell’s approach was modern, pointing out that the damage to the spinal cord occurred at the moment of injury, and was not due to continued pressure (fig ). He emphasised that all the efforts of the surgeons should be devoted to making an accurate diagnosis in the first instance, and that operation on the spinal column was both www.postgradmedj.com dangerous and useless. He also pointed out that, in cases of paraplegia, death was attributable to the retention of urine and subsequent inflammation of the renal tract. This is the first mention of renal failure being a cause of death. Bell’s views received wide acceptance in Britain. There was little advance in treatment throughout the th century but there was a better understanding of the pathological sequelae. Renal failure remained the main cause of death. Thomas Curling (–)  described the suppurative consequences of paralysis of the bladder on the kidneys, and pointed out that the survival time was proportional to the severity of the infection. Sir William Gull (–),  William Thorburn (–), and Charles Fagge (–) also drew attention to the consequences of renal suppuration in this condition. Germany The first successful account of the management of spinal injuries was by Wilhelm Wagner (–) a general surgeon working alone in a small workers compensation hospital, Ko¨nigshu¨tte Hospital in Upper Silesia, where he spent his whole career (fig ). He developed the practical treatment of spinal injuries and demonstrated how patients could and should be treated. He wrote a book with his former pupil, Paul Stolper (– ), on injuries of the spine and spinal cord. This dealt with every aspect of the subject. He started with anatomy of the spinal column, pathology of injury, the mechanism of injury, the symptomatology, and practical treatment including the indications for surgery. He understood the necessity of relieving pressure in preventing pressure sores and was concerned to prevent subsequent deformity. He identified six major problems: sepsis from pressure sores; treatment of cervical fractures; post-traumatic syringomyelia; infection of the chest; stones in the kidneys leading to sepsis of the renal tract; and the necessity of immobilising patients in bed until the fracture healed. The textbook is remarkable in its breadth of vision and its emphasis upon such commonplace but vital aspects of treatment as how the patient should be transported and nursed. Particular attention was paid to the pressure points and positioning of the patient. Water beds were used. He emphasised the need to prevent soiling of the mattress in incontinent patients. For doubly incontinent patients special beds were designed, such as those used for cholera patients, with a bucket underneath that could be removed. Once the fracture had healed the patient was mobilised and put into a bath. The object of treatment of the spine was to establish bony union. Wagner was opposed to operative treatment on the spine and recommended that radiographs should be used to estimate the position of the fracture. He recommended palpation of the kyphus to reduce a dislocation. He described in detail how a dislocated cervical spine could be reduced. He devoted pages to the description of how the bladder should be managed. Wagner treated patients with spinal injuries and was able to mobilise them. He gave opinions in court about their life expectancy so they were probably returning home. It is remarkable that he carried out all this work alone in a municipal hospital without an academic position. At the same time, Theodor Kocher (–), professor of surgery at Bern was also interested in spinal injuries. He carried out extensive research but his work was mainly on an anatomical and physiological basis. It is impossible to determine from his writings how many patients with spinal injuries he treated and whether they were successfully discharged home. The textbooks by Kocher () and Wagner and Stolper () became the standard reference work and were referred to by subsequent writers. FIRST WORLD WAR Until the advent of the first world war spinal injury cases were few in number and it took surgeons many years to collect a series of cases. It was the first world war that served as the catalyst for the concept of the modern management of spinal injuries. Three of the belligerents, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, faced with overwhelming numbers of casualties established spinal units that showed remarkable similarities. They were all staffed by a multidisciplinary team. Surgeons, urologists, and neurologists worked together. One unit in Germany had a ward solely devoted to pressure sores. They all emphasised the vital necessity of teamwork, regular turning, and the need to give primacy to nursing care and physiotherapy but this did not take place as many patients developed pressure sores and severe sepsis. The importance of collaborative work and teaching was recognised and they all held meetings to discuss problems. Major sources of concern were whether a laminectomy should be performed and whether the bladder should be drained by continuous drainage or intermittent catheterisation. All the papers from that time reported high mortality. BETWEEN THE WARS At the end of the first world war the casualties ceased. The military hospitals closed down and along with them the acute Figure

Spinal injuries www.postgradmedj.com spinal units. The physicians and surgeons returned to their general practice of neurology and neurosurgery and in the United Kingdom those patients who survived were looked after on a custodial basis at the Royal Star and Garter Home, on a 
bedded unit annexed to Queen Square, and at a home run by the Not-forgotten Association at Clapham Park. There is no record of the units continuing in France or Germany. THE MODERN ERA At the beginning of the th century Germany was dominant intellectually, economically, and medically in the world. The logical place for the evolution of spinal injury management would have been in Germany. They already had fine spinal units for the treatment of servicemen injured in the first world war but this did not take place. With the rise of the Nazis to power there was an attack upon hospital medicine and medical training. Marching and political indoctrination assumed a place in the syllabus at the expense of scientific training. Jewish doctors were expelled from their posts and eventually from Germany itself. The development of the treatment of spinal injuries shifted to the United States of America. THE UNITED STATES Charles Frazier (–) had looked after spinal injury patients in the first world war and wrote a book on the subject. This book is not just a historic document but a major textbook. It is not clear how many of these patients Frazier treated, whether they were in separate neurosurgical beds, in general wards, or on a spinal unit. His comprehensive survey quoted not only his own cases, but also a total of
 cases of spinal injuries from the world literature. The work involved in translating German and French papers (he quotes Wilhelm Wagner in four different sections), and the detailed statistical analysis on results of surgery, prognosis, life expectancy, discharge home and work, make this a formidable source of information and very humbling. He was opposed to surgery but he only devoted a page and a half to physical management. Donald Munro (–) was acknowledged by his contemporaries to be the father of the treatment of paraplegia. He set up the first effective treatment centre for spinal injuries at the City Hospital in Boston. Munro had been Frazier’s assistant in  at the Augustana Hospital, Chicago. In  he was appointed to the Boston City Hospital on the general surgical staff. He was Figure

Silver www.postgradmedj.com primarily occupied in administering anaesthesia to other surgeons’ private patients. In  he took charge of the surgical part of the neurological unit in conjunction with Dr Abraham Myerson (–) and Dr Stanley Cobb (–). That service expanded. Boston City Hospital was under the shadow of a superb neurosurgical service rendered by Harvey Cushing at the neighbouring Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Harvard Medical School serviced three hospitals: Massachusetts General, Peter Bent Brigham, and the City Hospital. At that stage the feeling at Harvard was that they should set up an academic unit. All this work was being done by the neurosurgeons and neurology did not have the same standing as neurosurgery. The Harvard Neurological Unit at Boston City Hospital was founded to fill this gap funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The unit was built as a research orientated department with a staff primarily of full time academics. Dr Stanley Cobb was chosen to be its first director. Munro was appointed professor of neurosurgery. He pursued his studies and researches on traumatic injuries of the brain and spinal cord. He realised that more than half of neurosurgical admissions were the result of trauma. The City Hospital was paid for by public taxes and it was responsible for trauma cases. Treatment was consumer driven. Munro realised that these patients could be successfully treated. His doctrine is the cornerstone of modern treatment of spinal injuries: ‘‘…no matter how extensive the paralysis may be in such a patient and provided only that he has full use of his hands, arms and shoulders, ambulation, with infallible  hour control of bladder and bowel (without the need of a urinal or other artificial aid)—as well as that degree of overall rehabilitation that comes only with the ability to lead a normal social and work life within the limits imposed by the necessary use of braces and crutches—is well within the possibilities of present-day treatment’’. He emphasised that care of the bladder was paramount and would not countenance genitourinary sepsis in his service. He developed the Munro method of tidal drainage. He recognised, in a forthright dogmatic way, that the patient’s skin had to be protected from getting pressure sores. He said pressure sores always antedated bedsores. The former developed because of prolonged weight bearing on bony prominences and of maceration of the horny layers of the skin. The latter followed because of interference with the skin-vascular reflexes. According to Munro the best treatment of bedsores was prevention and this should be accomplished by keeping the patient constantly dry and never allowing him to lie in a wet bed and turning the patient every two hours night and day. He believed that the treatment of the patient’s spine was of only secondary importance, and that no effort should be made to reduce a fracture by operation, but that gentle traction should be used to replace the vertebrae. Munro took a holistic approach to the overall management of the spinal injury patient. He recognised the virtues of physiotherapy in mobilising patients, was willing to carry out rhizotomies to eliminate spasm, and was a strenuous advocate of returning patients home to a wheelchair life. He realised the financial implications of spinal injury. This problem was overcome by funding from the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company of Boston who arranged to concentrate those patients they were responsible for at the Neurosurgical Unit at Boston City Hospital. Patients were seen by nurse counsellors and were treated by genitourinary consultants, all paid for by the insurance company. Rehabilitation led to healthy patients who could care for themselves, were able to lead active social and work lives, and had regained their self respect. For the insurance company rehabilitation of spinal patients led to financial benefits in the long term because of a reduced need for care. Munro was a forceful, inspirational writer, teacher, and prophet who profoundly influenced civilian doctors throughout North America and, when America became involved in the second world war, doctors in the American armed forces. A successful series of veterans hospitals were set up in the United States where spinal patients were treated. The leading hospital was established at Long Beach, California headed by Ernest Bors (–). Munro also influenced Sir Ludwig Guttmann. Figure

Spinal injuries www.postgradmedj.com SECOND WORLD WAR As Hitler’s aggression spread across Europe, it was realised that a resumption of hostilities was inevitable. Unlike the first world war, when casualties had all been servicemen, many civilian casualties were anticipated because of the bombing. Specialised orthopaedic units were established to deal with the many types of trauma. Provision was made to deal with peripheral nerve and spinal injuries cases. In  George Riddoch (–) was appointed consultant neurologist to the army with the rank of brigadier. More significantly, he was chairman of the Medical Research Council Committee on peripheral nerve injury with responsibility for setting up spinal injury units. He, like other doctors such as Geoffrey Jefferson (–), remembered his experience from the first world war. Riddoch had looked after patients with spinal injuries at the Empire Hospital during the first world war and had carried out fundamental work with Henry Head (–) on rehabilitation and the pathophysiology of spinal cord injuries. Just as second lieutenants in the infantry had returned to the second world war as generals, determined that there should be a different type of war with abolition of trench warfare and conservation of soldiers’ lives, so Riddoch was determined that provision would be made for servicemen with spinal injuries. Four units were designated to receive acute spinal casualities: Agnes Hunt and Robert Jones Hospital at Oswestry serving the Midlands, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore serving London, EMS Hospital Winwick, Warrington serving the North West, and Bangour Hospital serving Scotland. These four units were set up in . ‘‘Incurable’’ patients were to be transferred to long term units. A unit was supposed to be established at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Hospital to serve the South of England but Professor Herbert Seddon (–) was unwilling to give up any beds so its opening was delayed until the opening of the second front when the National Spinal Injuries Centre was set up at Stoke Mandeville with Ludwig Guttmann as the first director. LUDWIG GUTTMANN Ludwig Guttmann (–) is regarded by many as the founder of the modern treatment of spinal injuries. He was born in Silesia in . He finished his schooling in  and as part of his military service he was recruited as a medical orderly, working at the Accident Hospital for Coalminers (Knappsschafts-Lazarett) in his hometown of Ko¨nigshu¨tte, where Wagner had treated spinal injury patients  years previously. He had his first contact with a spinal injury patient, a miner, who he was told would be dead within a few weeks from pressure sores. When the first world war ended he trained as a doctor and worked for Otfrid Foerster (–) in Breslau. Despite having worked successfully as first assistant to Foerster, Guttmann was expelled from his university appointment and his job in  under the Nuremberg Laws and his title changed to ‘‘Krankenbehandler’’ (one who treats the sick). He was only allowed to treat Jewish patients at the Jewish Hospital in total isolation from the universities and academic medicine. The German Neurological Association was dissolved in . Guttmann escaped to England with his family in  and began work almost immediately as a research fellow at the Nuffield Department of Neurosurgery in Oxford. There too, he was not allowed to treat patients, as his neurosurgical operative skill (he was trained in the European and not the Cushing tradition) was not recognised. When Guttmann came to Stoke Mandeville in February
 to set up the spinal unit he was already armed with well established ideas on spinal cord physiology, neurosurgical techniques, and rehabilitation (fig ). Despite being single handed, he insisted on having three research sessions to continue his work on sweating. He recognised, from his work in Germany on peripheral nerves, the need for: N Specialised spinal units N Continuous treatment N After care N Immediate treatment by the appropriate specialist N Thorough documentation N Supervision of patients immediately after injury N Late supervision N Availability of public health service Figure

Silver www.postgradmedj.com N Cooperation of health service with Ministry of Pensions and employer N Rehabilitation/work N Not to leave the patient alone in the reconditioning period He adapted these peripheral nerve injury principles and expanded them to treat spinal patients. He was determined and refused to accept that patients who were the hopeless and helpless should be cast on the human scrap heap. He was a very inspiring man and made both patients and staff feel wanted and worthwhile. He motivated other people and his enthusiasm was infectious. He made people believe that they were part of something bigger than themselves, so staff and patients cooperated fully (fig ). I have experienced this personally. He had been made to feel worthless while in Germany and in Oxford, so he had great empathy, sympathy, and charisma to motivate people to do the work. He showed leadership. Because of his force of personality he saw that things were done. At the outset and much to the staff’s annoyance, he gave the order that all patients should be turned supine and prone or from one side to another, every two hours, night and day, waking or sleeping. To ensure that his orders were being carried out, he began appearing on the ward unexpectedly, at all hours. He bullied patients and staff and established a series of checks and monitors. He taught patients and staff and instituted research at all levels. He recognised the value of physiotherapy and at any early stage incorporated sport into rehabilitation. His work was acknowledged by contemporaneous accounts (table ). CONCLUSIONS Unquestionably Guttmann put the ideas together. Few of them were original. They were all in existence before and being practised by Wagner and Munro. It was his drive, his energy, his enthusiasm, his intolerance of carelessness, refusal to accept inefficiency and low standards of treatment, which wedded them together in a comprehensive treatment programme. The setting up of specialised units and the early transfer of patients under one consultant who could take all the decisions was backed up by full therapeutic treatment where all specialties were available. This was the cornerstone of spinal injury management. It is apparent that Wagner and Kocher had initiated these ideas and shown how it could be carried out but their ideas, possibly because of the advent of the first world war, were not continued. Foerster, apart from his great physiological work, incorporated physical methods of treatment, which was revolutionary. Munro at the City Hospital, Boston, Guttmann at Stoke Mandeville, and Bors at the Long Beach Veterans Hospital showed how the treatment could be successfully carried out. The credit for the development of the treatment lies with Munro who was the first to practise it. Munro set out a clear programme of treatment and arranged with the insurance companies to receive the spinal cases at his hospital. Unfortunately, he only had  beds but his publications were extremely influential, particularly with doctors treating American spinal injury casualties from the second world war and with Ludwig Guttmann. While Munro showed the way, it is Guttmann in the United Kingdom who instituted an integrated programme of treatment facilitated by the favourable structure of the health service. Funding: none.

ﺔﯾﺑرﻌﻟا 中文 Français Русский Español Every year, around the world, between   and   people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). The majority of  spinal cord injuries are due to preventable causes such as road traffic crashes, falls or violence. People with a spinal cord injury are two to five times more likely to die prematurely than people without a spinal cord injury, with worse survival rates in lowand middle-income countries. Spinal cord injury is associated with lower rates of  school enrollment and economic participation, and it carries substantial individual and societal costs. Key facts The term ‘spinal cord injury’ refers to damage to the spinal cord resulting from trauma (e.g. a car crash) or from disease or degeneration (e.g. cancer). There is no reliable estimate of global prevalence, but estimated annual global incidence is  to  cases per million population. Up to % of these cases are due to traumatic causes, though the proportion of non-traumatic spinal cord injury appears to be growing. Symptoms of spinal cord injury depend on the severity of injury and its location on the spinal cord. Symptoms may include partial or complete loss of sensory function or motor control of arms, legs and/or body. The most severe spinal cord injury a�ects the systems that regulate bowel or bladder control, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Most people with spinal cord injury experience chronic pain. Demographic trends Males are most at risk in young adulthood (years) and older age (+). Females are most at risk in adolescence (-) and older age (+). Studies report male-to-female ratios of at least : among adults, sometimes much higher. Mortality Mortality risk is highest in the �rst year after injury and remains high compared to the general population. People with spinal cord injury are  to  times more likely to die prematurely than people without SCI. Mortality risk increases with injury level and severity and is strongly in�uenced by availability of timely, quality medical care. Transfer method to hospital after injury and time to hospital admission are important factors. Preventable secondary conditions (e.g. infections from untreated pressure ulcers) are no longer among the leading causes of death of people with spinal cord injury in high-income countries, but these conditions remain the main causes of death of people with spinal cord injury in low-income countries. Health, economic and social consequences Spinal cord injury is associated with a risk of developing secondary conditions that can be debilitating and even life-threatening—e.g. deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infections, muscle spasms, osteoporosis, pressure ulcers, chronic pain, and respiratory complications. Acute care, rehabilitation services and ongoing health maintenance are essential for prevention and management of these conditions. Spinal cord injury may render a person dependent on caregivers. Assistive technology is often required to facilitate mobility, communication, self-care or domestic activities. An estimated -% of people with spinal cord injury show clinically signi�cant signs of depression, which in turn has a negative impact on improvements in functioning and overall health. Misconceptions, negative attitudes and physical barriers to basic mobility result in the exclusion of many people from full participation in society. Children with spinal cord injury are less likely than their peers to start school, and once enrolled, less likely to advance. Adults with spinal cord injury face similar barriers to economic participation, with a global unemployment rate of more than %. Existing data do not allow for global cost estimates of spinal cord injury, but they do o�er a general picture. The level and severity of  the injury have an important influence on costs--injuries higher up on the spinal cord (e.g. tetraplegia vs. paraplegia) incur higher costs. Direct costs are highest in the first year after spinal cord injury onset and then decrease significantly over time. Indirect costs, in particular lost earnings, often exceed direct costs. Much of  the cost is borne by people with spinal cord injury. Costs of  spinal cord injury are higher than those of  comparable conditions such as dementia, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. Prevention The leading causes of spinal cord injury are road tra�c crashes, falls and violence (including attempted suicide). A signi�cant proportion of traumatic spinal cord injury is due to work or sports-related injuries. E�ective interventions are available to prevent several of the main causes of spinal cord injury, including improvements in roads, vehicles and people’s behaviour on the roads to avoid road tra�c crashes, window guards to prevent falls, and policies to thwart the harmful use of alcohol and access to �rearms to reduce violence. Improving care and overcoming barriers Many of the consequences associated with spinal cord injury do not result from the condition itself, but from inadequate medical care and rehabilitation services, and from barriers in the physical, social and policy environments. Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) requires action to address these gaps and barriers. Essential measures for improving the survival, health and participation of people with spinal cord injury include the following. Timely, appropriate pre-hospital management: quick recognition of  suspected spinal cord injury, rapid evaluation and initiation of  injury management, including immobilization of  the spine. Acute care (including surgical intervention) appropriate to the type and severity of  injury, degree of instability, presence of  neural compression, and in accordance with the wishes of  the patient and their family. Access to ongoing health care, health education and products (e.g. catheters) to reduce risk of secondary conditions and improve quality of  life. Access to skilled rehabilitation and mental health services to maximize functioning, independence, overall wellbeing and community integration. Management of  bladder and bowel function is of primary importance. Access to appropriate assistive devices that can enable people to perform everyday activities they would not otherwise be able to undertake, reducing functional limitations and dependency. Only % of  people in lowand middle-income countries have access to the assistive devices they need. Specialized knowledge and skills among providers of  medical care and rehabilitation services. Essential measures to secure the right to education and economic participation include legislation, policy and programmes that promote the following: physically accessible homes, schools, workplaces, hospitals and transportation; inclusive education; elimination of  discrimination in employment and educational settings; Vocational rehabilitation to optimize the chance of  employment; micro-finance and other forms of  self-employment benefits to support alternative forms of  economic self-sufficiency; access to social support payments that do not act as disincentive to return to work; and correct understanding of  spinal cord injury and positive attitudes towards people living with it. WHO response WHO works across the spectrum from primary prevention of traumatic and non-traumatic causes of spinal cord injury, improvements in trauma care, strengthening health and rehabilitation services, and support for inclusion of people with spinal cord injuries. WHO: works in a multisectoral manner, in partnership with national stakeholders from a variety of  sectors (e.g. health, police, transport, education) to improve prevention of  spinal cord injury including of road traffic injuries, falls, violence and neural tube defects; guides and supports Member States to increase awareness of  disability issues, and promotes the inclusion of  disability as a component in national health policies and programmes; facilitates data collection and dissemination of  disability-related data and information; develops normative tools, including guidelines and good practice examples to strengthen primary prevention (road traffic crashes, falls and violence), trauma care, health care, rehabilitation and support and assistance; builds capacity among health policy-makers and service providers; promotes scaling up of  community-based rehabilitation; and promotes strategies to ensure that people with disabilities are knowledgeable about their own health conditions, and that health-care personnel support and protect the rights and dignity of  persons with disabilities. Trauma: Spinal Cord Injury Matthew J. Eckert, MDa,*, Matthew J. Martin, MDa,b INTRODUCTION Traumatic spine and spinal cord injury (SCI) occurred in roughly , US citizens in , with an estimated prevalence of approximately , injured persons. Although the injury has historically been a disease of younger adult men, a progressive increase in SCI incidence among the elderly has been reported over the last few decades. Upwards of % of SCI patients suffer multiple injuries concomitant with spinal cord trauma, contributing to the high rates of associated complications during the acute and long-term phases of care. SCI is associated with significant reductions in life expectancy across the spectrum of injury and age at time of insult. Patients who survive the initial injury face significant risks of medical complications throughout the rest of their lives. More than half of all SCI patients will develop complications during the initial hospital stay, with higher rates corresponding to increased a Department of Surgery, General Surgery, Madigan Army Medical Center, -A Jackson Avenue, Tacoma, WA , USA; b Trauma and Emergency Surgery Service, Legacy Emanuel Medical Center,  N.

For the trauma/acute care surgeon managing SCI patients during the acute phase of injury, respiratory compromise and shock are of primary concern, as discussed later. During the initial presentation and evaluation of SCI patients, almost all other injuries should take precedent in both evaluation and management, unless the SCI is impeding the airway (cervical spine) or the hemodynamics (neurogenic shock). No emergent imaging of the spine is required before a laparotomy or other life-saving surgical intervention. Spinal immobilization is adequate for initial prevention of further injury while addressing sources of hemorrhage. Prevention of hypotension and hypoxia is also critical to mitigating further neurologic injury. Even if one of the rare spinal cord emergencies is encountered, such as a progressively worsening examination with cord compression that requires surgical decompression, your job will be to stabilize the patient and address any other life-threatening injury before intervention by a spine surgeon. Hypotension in the setting of a suspected acute traumatic SCI should always be first assumed to be due to hypovolemia/hemorrhage, until ruled out. ASSESSMENT OF SPINAL CORD INJURIES The critical step in early evaluation of patients with possible SCI is recognition of patients at risk and a focused, yet thorough neurologic examination. Too often the Table

Complications in the management of patients with spine trauma. Neurosurg Clin N Am ;:–; with permission. Eckert & Martin steps of physical examination are deferred to the all-knowing computed tomographic (CT) scanner. This delay can slow recognition of SCI and establishment of baseline function and delay consultation of appropriate specialists and the initiation of preventive measures avoiding further secondary injury. The performance of such an examination is frequently overlooked in busy trauma bays. The main points are that in addition to global neurologic disability (Glasgow Coma Scale and pupil examination), the secondary survey of the patient should include sensory and motor testing in upper and lower extremity muscle groups as well as an anorectal examination for tone and sensation. Table  lists the key muscle groups and their corresponding motor level that should be checked to determine the motor level of the injury. Both upper and lower extremities and the right and left sides should be tested, because certain syndromes may cause “skip” patterns or have unilateral asymmetric deficits (eg, central cord syndrome, Brown-Se´ quard). Both the motor and the sensory level should be clearly documented in the neurologic portion of the admission history and physical examination as well as communicated to any consulting spine provider. The distinction of complete and incomplete cord injury should be made because this may influence operative decision making such as decompressive laminectomy or removal of bone fragments that are compressing the spinal cord. A “complete” injury is an injury pattern in which there is absolutely no spine-mediated neurologic function below the level of the injury. An “incomplete” injury is one in which there is any function below the level of injury, typically in the form of intact sensation (such as perineal) or slight distal motor function. Sacral root sparing, which may allow some residual anal sphincter function or sensation or slight movement of a great toe, is an indication that the injury is incomplete and carries a better prognosis for recovery of some degree of neurologic function. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI is the most frequently used and studied spinal injury severity assessment score. ASIA injury scoring is dependent on the presence or absence of motor function and sacral nerve root sparing below the level of injury (Fig. ). Knowledge of which muscle group is fired by each spinal cord level and a more thorough checking for neurologic function distal to the apparent spinal cord level (including Table

Eckert & Martin rectal examination) can help identify patients with incomplete injuries who may benefit from more urgent operative intervention. In addition, such an examination may help identify the possible injury location in order to better immobilize and prevent iatrogenic extension of the neurologic deficit. If spinal shock is present, it cannot be determined whether the injury is complete or incomplete until  to  hours after the shock period resolves. Although imaging of the spine is often thought of as being primarily about the bony structures, it is important to remember that complete assessment for spine injury and spinal stability requires assessment of the bone, the ligaments, and the spinal cord itself. Traditional plain radiograph imaging of the spine only evaluates the bony component and has essentially been replaced by the widespread availability and efficiency of modern multidetector CT imaging. Although the utility of plain radiograph screening of the cervical spine in select low-risk patients has been extensively studied, numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of CT versus plain radiograph for screening acutely injured patients with suspected or at risk for spine injury.– Negative predictive values approaching % have been reported in several trials, particularly with relation to the presence of a clinically unstable injury or injury requiring intervention.– Although CT is ideal for screening identification of bony injury and suggestion of alignment abnormalities, the diagnostic accuracy of CT for spinal cord, ligamentous, and soft tissue injury is exceeded by MRI., Patients with deficits on examination, CT findings suggestive of injury to the cord, disks, ligaments, or nerve roots, or unexplained neurologic examination may benefit from early MRI for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. SPINAL SHOCK VERSUS NEUROGENIC SHOCK The terms “spinal shock” and “neurogenic shock” are often both used inappropriately or incorrectly, or are confused for one another in the clinical setting. Neurogenic shock is the hemodynamic consequence of the SCI, classically characterized by hypotension due to vasodilation and increased perfusion of the lower extremities (also known as “warm shock”). In cases of higher SCI (cervical spine), hypotension may often be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia. This pattern is a relatively unique and specific hemodynamic pattern to SCI and should prompt immediate evaluation and interventions. Cervical spine and high thoracic spine injuries may result in loss of sympathetic cardiac stimulation (bradycardia) and vasomotor tone in the lower body (hypotension) that will benefit from early initiation of vasopressor medication along with standard trauma resuscitation to restore intravascular volume status. Although neurogenic shock refers to a hemodynamic pattern, spinal shock refers to the neurologic examination findings that may be seen after an acute SCI. The diagnosis of spinal shock is made in the presence of complete loss of reflexes below the level of injury, including the monosynaptic pathways. If spinal shock is present, this means that it is not yet known what the ultimate amount of functional recovery will be. You will have to wait until the spinal shock period is over. If spinal shock is not present, or it has resolved, then whatever neurologic deficits you have at that time are likely to be fixed and permanent. Thus, for the patient presenting with paralysis in spinal shock, an unknown amount of functional recovery may still occur. Spinal shock is diagnosed through evaluation of the bulbocavernosus and/or cremasteric reflexes. If these reflexes are absent, then the patient is in spinal shock, and when they return, the shock period has ended. Once the period of spinal shock has ended and the bulbocavernosus and/or cremasteric reflexes have returned, then the neurologic examination at that time likely reflects what the permanent level and degree of deficits will be. Trauma: Spinal Cord Injury MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE SPINAL CORD INJURY The management of SCI begins with spine precautions (logrolling, cervical collar) and protection from further injury. Spinal immobilization precautions do not mean lying flat and motionless once the initial trauma evaluation has been completed. Reverse Trendelenburg position up to � will greatly benefit, and participatory pulmonary toilet should begin if they are not intubated. Ensure adequate pain control to maximize tidal volumes. Have a low threshold for nasogastric decompression because gastric ileus often accompanies SCI with paraplegia or quadriplegia. Similarly, bladder dysfunction is common, and a urinary catheter should be placed if not already present. Begin management of pressure points with padding and frequent patient repositioning immediately for paralyzed patients. Do not forget the psychological and emotional aspects of these injuries, particularly in young acutely injured patients. Early mental health professional and/or chaplain consultation to begin helping the patient deal with the almost uniform depression and grieving over the loss of bodily function that accompanies these injuries is essential. Similar to studies of traumatic brain injury, avoidance of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < mm Hg) and hypoxia is critical to avoiding further secondary SCI., Neurogenic shock may manifest as hypotension, which is poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation but responds briskly to vasopressor agents. In pure neurogenic shock, there is no associated tachycardia; the extremities may be warm and dry rather than cold and clammy, and typically, the patient has a significant cervical SCI. Treatment involves judicious volume resuscitation and the use of vasopressors to support blood pressure. A purely peripheral vasoconstrictor such as Neo-Synephrine is often used, but in the multitrauma patient or the patient with associated bradycardia, a balanced vasopressor such as norepinephrine is a better choice. Maintaining the mean arterial pressure greater than  mm Hg for up to  days after injury has been associated with improved ASIA scores and is recommended in current guidelines., The concept of spinal cord perfusion pressure monitoring through direct measure of intraspinal pressure (ISP) after placement of an intradural catheter has demonstrated significant promise. Small trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy of monitoring ISP at the site of maximal cord edema for up to  week after injury.– Controversy persists over the utility of high-dose systemic steroids following blunt SCI. The series of National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS) I-III trials failed to demonstrate any difference in neurologic outcomes after high-dose methylprednisolone.– Post hoc subgroup analyses in the later NASCIS trials showed a -point (ASIA) motor scoring improvement across  muscle groups but did not correlate with any measure of functional improvement or effect upon disability. In contrast, patients receiving high-dose steroids consistently suffered increased rates of infectious complications, gastric ulceration, venothromboembolic events, wound complications, and trended toward increased mortality related to pulmonary complications. Numerous additional trials confirmed the NASCIS outcomes with similar complication profiles., The use of high-dose steroids after penetrating SCI has consistently shown poor outcomes.– Previous guidelines had recommended intravenous steroid bolus and infusion for all patients with blunt SCI and no contraindication to treatment. However, this approach has now been widely abandoned because of the highly questionable clinical benefit identified in the NASCIS trials as well as more recent data indicating no benefit to steroid use. Recent evidence-based management guidelines recommend against the use of high-dose steroids for all acute SCI. There may be a role for steroid use in highly select or atypical types of spinal cord trauma and injury, and this decision should be at the discretion of the managing spine surgeon. Eckert & Martin Not infrequently, the examination of an injured patient will suggest neurologic deficit without any obvious supporting radiographic findings. These SCI without radiographic abnormalities (SCIWORA) represent a challenging group because limited evidence and support for treatment have been established. Unfortunately, the ultimate neurologic outcome in SCIWORA patients appears correlated with the initial deficits on examination similar to those patients with radiographic abnormalities and neurologic deficits. MRI appears particularly useful in identifying subtle intraneural and extraneural abnormalities that may be associated with the neurologic deficits and correlate with outcomes. Supportive care is similar to that described previously for those patients with neurologic injury and radiographic abnormalities. Despite increased reports on populations of SCIWORA patients, limited high-quality data are available, and no randomized controlled trials of management have been conducted. The timing of surgical spinal decompression in the setting of compressive phenomena, such as epidural hematoma, cord edema or hemorrhage, or impinging bony fragments and foreign bodies, has been extensively studied. Preclinical models have demonstrated that the extent and duration of cord compression correlate with ultimate neurologic deficit., Human series have suggested that early decompression in the first  to  hours after injury in those patients with incomplete SCI is associated with improved neurologic outcomes. In the Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study, patients with cervical SCI that underwent decompression in the first  hours after injury had a significant improvement in ASIA grade. Additional studies have confirmed the benefits of early decompression for these incomplete patients; however, not all trials of time to decompression have shown neurologic improvement with early intervention. Early surgical decompression is also associated with decreased pulmonary morbidity and duration of mechanical ventilation as well as decreased intensive care unit and hospital length of stay., Unfortunately, surgical decompression in patients presenting with ASIA A complete injury has not shown significant improvements in neurologic outcomes., As previously noted, one of the early measures in the assessment and stabilization of a suspected SCI patient is the prevention of future mechanical injury due to instability of the spinal column. Although logroll precautions, maintenance of axial alignment, pressure point management, and attentive nursing care are generally adequate for thoracolumbar spinal protection, the cervical spine is generally protected with specialized cervical immobilization devices, or “c-collars.” Controversy persists regarding the actual effectiveness and necessity of these devices to maintain proper alignment and prevent skeletal motion.– In addition, these hard devices may be associated with development of pressure ulceration in upwards of % of patients. For the obtunded trauma patient with associated brain injury or critical illness in whom the cervical spine cannot be cleared by standard imaging and physical examination, a particular challenge arises. Traditionally, these patients were left in a hard cervical collar until examinable or until an MRI or other imaging adjunct demonstrated no evidence of injury. Recent studies from multiple centers have demonstrated the safety of cervical collar removal after a negative high-quality CT given negative predictive values of % for unstable injuries. As a result of these studies, practice patterns are changing with expected decreased utilization of MRI resources and prevention of complications of hard cervical immobilization devices. MANAGEMENT OF PENETRATING SPINE TRAUMA Penetrating SCI is most commonly secondary to gunshot wounds and typically results in complete SCI due to direct trauma to the cord and associated blast effect as well as Trauma: Spinal Cord Injury secondary hemorrhage and ischemia. In civilian trauma centers, the thoracolumbar spine is the region most frequently injured. The management options for open spine trauma are not much different than those for closed spine trauma, even in patients with open vertebral column fractures. The wound must be managed with irrigation and debridement of all nonviable tissues and early antibiotic coverage. The choice of antibiotics is generally the same as for patients with open extremity fractures, and there are no good data on recommended duration of therapy (ranges of  hours to  days reported). Patients with associated intestinal injuries, particularly if those injuries communicate with the spinal column injury, may require broader coverage. These devastating injuries will obviously require multidisciplinary care for optimal outcomes. Incomplete SCI, cauda equina syndrome, or evidence of cord compression after penetrating injury due to hematoma or bony fragments may benefit from surgical decompression. In addition, surgical stabilization of unstable vertebral column injuries is necessary in any patient likely to survive the acute phase of care. Exploration of the injuries may be required for debridement, neurologic deterioration due to cord compression, or persistent cerebrospinal fluid leak. Wound infection, spinal column instability, and cerebrospinal fluid leaks were the most common complications in a series of penetrating SCI. These penetrating injuries are frequently managed conservatively as outcomes have been shown to be equivocal or even more favorable in nonoperative management. AIRWAY MANAGEMENT The need for appropriate airway management is of particular importance for patients with cervical SCIs. Most patients with high cervical SCIs will present with quadriplegia and respiratory distress or arrest and clearly require intubation. The difficult patient population is the lower cervical spine injury (C-C) and upper thoracic spine (T-T), who frequently present with no obvious respiratory distress due to the ability to continue shallow breathing. Be wary of these patients: previous reports have demonstrated that up to % will slowly decompensate and require a delayed emergent airway intervention., This can result in secondary SCI due to hypoxia and trauma from manipulation during emergent intubation attempts. Over a period of several hours to days, the shallow breathing will result in progressive atelectasis, pulmonary consolidation or pneumonia, and finally, acute hypoxic decompensation. The insidious airway collapse in this setting can be severely harmful or even fatal and should be anticipated. A low threshold for intubating these patients semi-electively for the initial hospital period or before transfer may be prudent, because up to % will require intubation in the first
 hours after cervical SCI. Factors suggestive of early intubation include higher level of injury (above C), complete paralysis, the presence of associated injuries (particularly chest wall or intrathoracic), and low lung volumes on chest radiograph. If you have the capability to measure and follow vital capacity, then this may be a useful adjunct to identify the patient progressing to respiratory failure. Numerous publications discuss the methods for intubation in the patient with a cervical spine injury and the potential impact on spinal mobility. Direct laryngoscopy with manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine during the procedure has been shown to be safe and effective in  large studies., If available, fiberoptic intubation is safe and avoids significant spinal motion but requires manual stabilization during the procedure as well if the collar is released. Finally, a surgical airway is always an option and may be necessary for patients who will require long-term mechanical ventilation and/ or pulmonary toilet. Consideration should be given to potential incision location for anterior cervical spine surgical stabilization if indicated. Although the definitions of Eckert & Martin what constitutes “early” tracheostomy vary in the literature, those patients who require or are projected to require mechanical ventilation for more than  weeks after injury certainly may benefit from tracheostomy. Improved secretion control, enhanced facilitation of mechanical ventilation weaning, patient comfort, ability to participate in rehabilitation, and possibly reduced risks of pneumonia and resource utilization have been associated with tracheostomy in SCI patients.– SPINAL CORD SYNDROMES Although simple complete traumatic SCI is relatively straightforward, with a dense and complete neurologic deficit below the level of injury, there are several spinal cord syndromes involving injuries to an isolated segment that have a much more varied and subtle presentation. These syndromes can be easily missed or misdiagnosed if a thorough neurologic examination and appropriate differential diagnosis are not performed. Table  reviews the cause, diagnosis, and management for the common spinal syndromes. Although relatively uncommon, these syndromes have very characteristic presentations and common etiologic/mechanistic factors that Table

Central cord syndrome is almost always a flexion/extension injury in an elderly patient with preexisting spinal stenosis. Although spinal immobilization is often maintained in these patients because of the presence of neurologic deficits, it is typically not an unstable spine injury, and there is no proven benefit of immobilization with a cervical collar. BrownSe´ quard (or “cord hemisection”) is extremely uncommon and typically only seen after direct penetrating injury to the spinal cord that results in different unilateral and contralateral deficits. Anterior cord syndrome is typically a vascular cause related to injury or interruption of flow through the anterior spinal artery. For all of the spinal cord syndromes presenting with fixed and established defects, management is usually expectant and aimed at treating symptoms and pain., However, for any patient with a progressively worsening neurologic deficit, emergent consultation with a spine surgeon for possible decompression should be a priority. VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM AFTER SPINAL CORD INJURY Venous thromboembolism (VTE) events and appropriate prophylaxis are major concerns in the acute and long-term management of SCI patients. A recent large population study of roughly , SCI patients found an approximately .-fold increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and .-fold increased risk of pulmonary embolism compared with controls. The risks were greatest within the first  months following injury and with increasing age. Additional studies confirm the heightened risk in the early period after injury and with increased patient age, pointing to the significance of falls in older patients., Overall incidence of VTE after SCI in recent publications suggests an incidence of approximately % to %, with associated early mortality of .%, but up to % in patients greater than  years of age., For unclear reasons, the location of SCI along the spine may also be associated with VTE risk. Maung and colleagues found upper thoracic SCI to be associated with a higher rate of VTE compared with other spinal level injury. Variation in reported incidence of VTE is likely due to the timing and modality of screening methods. Duplex and Doppler ultrasonography are the most frequently and conveniently used screening modalities today. There is no clear consensus on the timing or schedule for screening after acute SCI; however, the systematic review by Furlan and Fehlings suggests that weekly screening for asymptomatic DVT in the early high-risk period following SCI may be appropriate. In recognizing the increased risk of VTE following SCI, optimal preventive measures are an important facet of care for these patients. Until recently, controversy persisted regarding the optimal treatment with mechanical and/or chemoprophylaxis. A series of studies has confirmed the superior efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated subcutaneous heparin for the prevention of VTE and a lower associated bleeding risk., Optimal dosing of LMWH remains controversial. Studies suggest that standard daily or twice daily enoxaparin dosing may not achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels in trauma patients; however, no consensus for dose adjustment currently exists., Combined preventive therapy with gradient elastic stockings or sequential pneumatic compression devices of the lower extremities and LMWH may offer an even greater reduction in VTE risk after SCI. Early initiation of chemoprophylaxis (< hours from injury) has been associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of VTE after SCI (% vs %) and recommended in at least one consensus guideline., For patients with contraindications to chemoprophylaxis or VTE despite treatment, retrievable vena cava filter placement may be appropriate. However, outside Eckert & Martin these unique situations, studies suggest empiric filter placement offers no benefit over routine mechanical/chemoprophylaxis for acute SCI.– SUMMARY The impact of a SCI in any trauma patient can range from a minor nuisance to devastating paralysis, and unfortunately, the full spectrum of these injuries is frequently seen after trauma. Although much of the damage is done at the time of presentation and irreversible immediately, adherence to comprehensive supportive care aimed at treating the injury and preventing secondary injury may make a significant difference in the patient’s ultimate functional outcome. Every physician should be able to perform a quick but thorough neurologic examination and understand the implications of significant examination findings such as spinal shock. REFERENCES .

What is a spinal cord injury? A spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the bundle of nerves and nerve ﬁbers that sends and receives signals from the brain. The spinal cord extends from the lower part of the brain down through the lower back. SCI can be caused by direct injury to the spinal cord itself or from damage to the tissue and bones (vertebrae) that surround the spinal cord. This damage can cause temporary or permanent changes in feeling, movement, strength, and body functions below the site of injury. Symptoms The symptoms of spinal cord injuries depend on the extent and location of the injury. The higher up on the spinal cord an injury occurs, more of the body is aﬀected. An injury higher on the spinal cord can cause paralysis in most of the body and aﬀect all limbs (tetraplegia or quadriplegia). An injury that occurs lower down the spinal cord may only aﬀect a person’s lower body and legs (paraplegia). Paralysis can happen immediately upon injury (primary damage) or develop over time from bleeding and swelling in the spinal cord and cell death (secondary damage). A spinal cord injury can damage a few, many, or almost all of the nerve ﬁbers that cross the site of injury. If the injury causes little or no nerve cell death, a person can make an almost complete recovery. SCI can cause one or more symptoms, including: Types of SCI SCI can be described as complete or incomplete. Numbness, tingling, or a loss of (or changes in) sensation in hands and feet Paralysis (loss of movement) Pain or pressure in the head, neck, or back Weakness in any part of the body Unnatural positions of the spine or head Loss of bladder and bowel control Problems with walking Diﬃculty breathing Changes in sexual function . An incomplete injury means the spinal cord is still able to send some messages to or from the brain. People with incomplete injuries still have some feeling, function, and muscle control below the site of their injury. . A complete injury means that there is no nerve communication below the injury site; muscle control, feeling, or function below the injury is lost. Anatomy of the spinal cord The spinal cord is a soft, cylindrical column of tightly bundled cells (nerve cells and glia), nerve ﬁbers that transmit nerve signals (called axons), and blood vessels. It sends and receives information between the brain and the rest of the body. Millions of nerve cells situated in the spinal cord itself coordinate complex patterns of movements such as rhythmic breathing and walking. The spinal cord extends from the brain to the lower back through a canal in the center of the vertebrae. Like the brain, the spinal cord is protected by three layers of tissue and is surrounded by the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) that acts as a cushion against shock or injury. Inside the spinal cord are: A collection of nerve cells and their projections that connect with other nerve cells to transmit and receive information (gray matter) Bundles of nerve ﬁbers (axons), some of which are coated with a whitish mixture of proteins and fat-like substances (white matter) that connects nerve cells over longer distances. Other types of nerve cells sit just outside the spinal cord and relay information to and from the brain. Cervical spinal nerves (known as C to C) in the neck control signals to the back of the head, the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands, and the diaphragm. Thoracic spinal nerves (known as T to T) in the upper mid-back control signals to the chest muscles, some muscles of the back, and many organ systems. Lumbar spinal nerves (known L to L) in the low back control signals to the lower parts of the abdomen and the back, the buttocks, some parts of the external genital organs, and parts of the leg. Sacral spinal nerves (known S to S) in the low back control signals to the thighs and lower parts of the legs, the feet, most of the external genital organs, and the area around the anus. The spinal column, which surrounds and protects the spinal cord, is made up of  rings of bone (vertebrae), pads of cartilage (discs), and narrow spaces called foramen that act as passages for spinal nerves to travel to and from the rest of the body. The spinal cord is particularly vulnerable to direct injury within the foramen. Who is more likely to get a spinal cord injury? Motor vehicle accidents and serious falls are the most common causes of SCI in the U.S. Other causes include acts of violence (primarily gunshot wounds and assaults), sports injuries, medical or surgical injury, industrial accidents, diseases, and conditions that can damage the spinal cord. Risk factors include age (either being between the ages of  and , or after age  for dangerous falls), alcohol use, certain diseases, or not wearing proper gear, such as a seat belt or protective sports equipment. How is a spinal cord injury diagnosed and treated? Diagnosing SCI The emergency room physician will check for movement or sensation at or below a suspected SCI, as well as for proper breathing, responsiveness, and weakness. Medical tests for SCI include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show brain and spinal trauma from injury, herniated discs (problems with the cartilage located between the vertebrae), vascular (blood vessel) irregularities, bleeding, inﬂammation that might compress the spine and spinal cord, and injury to the ligaments that support the cervical spine. Computerized tomography (CT) can detect bone fractures, bleeding, and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal). X-rays can show vertebrae misalignment and fractures within minutes of injury. Treating SCI At the accident scene, if SCI is suspected, emergency personnel will place a rigid collar around the neck and carefully place the individual on a backboard to prevent further damage to the spinal cord. They may use sedatives to relax the person and prevent movement. A breathing tube may be inserted if there are problems breathing and the body isn't receiving enough oxygen from the lungs. Doctors are now able to predict with reasonable accuracy the likely long-term outcome of SCI. This helps people experiencing SCI to set achievable goals for themselves and gives families and loved ones a realistic set of expectations for the future. Immediate treatment at the trauma center or emergency room may include: Realigning the spine using a rigid brace or mechanical force, which is usually done as soon as possible to stabilize the spine and prevent additional damage. Surgery to remove any fractured vertebrae, bone fragments, herniated discs, or other objects that are pressing on the spinal column. Spinal decompression surgery to relieve pressure within the spinal column may also be necessary in the days after injury. Results of neurosurgical studies show that, in some cases, earlier surgery is associated with better functional recovery. SCI may result in the following problems, which require treatment: Breathing problems—About one-third of people with a SCI will need temporary or permanent help with breathing and may require a breathing tube. Any injury to the spinal cord between the C-C segments can stop breathing as the nerves in this region cause the diaphragm to move and the lungs to expand. Special training regarding breathing and swallowing may be needed for the individual with SCI as well as for the caregivers. Pneumonia—Respiratory complications are the leading cause of death in people with SCI, commonly as a result of pneumonia. Individuals using a ventilator to assist with breathing (intubation), are at increased risk of developing pneumonia. The person with a SCI must be carefully monitored and treated with antibiotics if symptoms of pneumonia appear. Pneumonia can be prevented by clearing the throat and taking precautions to avoid food and liquids being sucked into the lungs (aspiration). Circulatory problems—Changes in circulation can lead to unstable blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), and blood clots that may appear days after injury. The injured person should be carefully monitored for each of these common post-SCI issues. People with spinal cord injuries are at increased risk for blood clots due to stagnation of blood ﬂow in the large veins in the legs. Anticoagulant drugs and compression stockings to increase blood ﬂow in the lower legs and feet and reduce the risk for blood clots. Stiﬀness and changes in muscle tone—Reﬂexes may become exaggerated over time, causing muscle stiﬀness and an increase in muscle tone (spasticity) that may require special treatment. Muscles below the injury site may deteriorate when they are not used. Autonomic dysreﬂexia—Autonomic dysreﬂexia is a life-threatening reﬂex action that primarily aﬀects those with injuries to the neck or upper back. Symptoms may include ﬂushing or sweating, a pounding headache, anxiety, sudden increase in blood pressure, vision changes, or goose bumps on the arms and legs. If possible, the person should be kept in a sitting position to keep blood ﬂowing to the legs and feet and help reduce blood pressure. Pressure sores (also known as pressure ulcers)—Pressure sores are areas of skin that have broken down because of continuous pressure on the skin and reduced blood ﬂow to the area. People with paraplegia and tetraplegia are susceptible to pressure sores. As a result, individuals must move and change their position periodically, either on their own or with the help of assistive devices or a caregiver. Pain—Some people with SCI develop neurogenic pain—an intense burning or stinging sensation. This pain may be constant or may come and go. It can be triggered by a variety of factors and may even be felt in parts of the body that have otherwise lost sensation. Treatments for chronic pain include medications, acupuncture, spinal or brain electrical stimulation, and surgery. However, none of these treatments are completely eﬀective at relieving neurogenic pain long term. Bladder and bowel problems—Individuals may need to use a catheter to empty their bladder and learn new ways to empty the bowels. The person may need to change their diet. Sexual function—Depending on the severity and location of the injury, and the individual’s recovery after the injury, their sexual function and fertility may be aﬀected. A urologist and other specialists can suggest diﬀerent options to support sexual functioning and health. Depression—Many people living with SCI may develop depression due to lifestyle changes after the injury. Therapy and medicine can help treat depression and other mental health conditions. Rehabilitation Rehabilitation programs for people with SCI combine physical therapies with skill-building activities and counseling designed to provide social and emotional support and increase the person’s independence and quality of life. The rehabilitation team is usually led by a doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation and may include social workers, physical and occupational therapists, recreational therapists, rehabilitation nurses, rehabilitation psychologists, vocational counselors, nutritionists, a case worker, and other specialists. The initial phase of rehabilitation after injury is usually focused on regaining communication skills and leg and arm strength. Adaptive or assistive devices may help people with SCI to regain independence and improve mobility and quality of life. Depending on the severity of the injury, the person may need braces, a wheelchair, electronic stimulators, assisted training with walking, neural prosthetics (assistive devices that may stimulate the nerves to restore lost functions), computer adaptations, and other computer-assisted technology. Adaptive devices can also help with communication skills such as writing, typing, and using the telephone. Physical therapy includes exercise programs geared toward strengthening muscles. Occupational therapy helps redevelop ﬁne motor skills, particularly those needed to perform activities of daily living such as getting in and out of a bed, personal hygiene, eating, and using the toilet. The person may learn how to cope with spasticity, autonomic dysreﬂexia, and neurogenic pain as part of their occupational therapy. Vocational rehabilitation includes identifying basic work skills and physical and cognitive capabilities that can support paid work. Through this process, the person and their team can identify potential workplaces and any assistive equipment that will be needed and arrange for a user-friendly workplace. Educational training can help the person develop skills for a new line of work that may be less dependent upon a person’s physical abilities. People with SCI are encouraged to participate in activities that provide a sense of satisfaction and self-esteem, such as educational classes, hobbies, special interest groups, and participating in family and community events. Recreation therapy encourages people with SCI to participate in sports, arts, or other leisure activities that they can do with their new level of mobility. This can help people achieve a balanced lifestyle that provides opportunities for socialization and self-expression. What are the latest updates on spinal cord injury? NINDS, a component of NIH, is a primary funder of research on the brain and spinal cord. NIH is the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world. NINDS investment in establishing the ﬁeld of neural devices has supported signiﬁcant advances with potential to improve post-injury quality of life for people with SCI. For example, researchers are developing an electrical stimulation system that is used as a network to restore functional independence through combined implants for hand function, postural control, and bowel and bladder control. Other research involves stimulating the spinal cord below the level of injury to help spared cells and ﬁbers function. NINDS has also led development of experimental brain computer interfaces that enable people to control a computer cursor or robotic arm directly from their brains. Current research on SCI is focused on advancing our understanding of the four key principles of spinal cord repair: Neuroprotection—Preventing cell death and protecting surviving nerve cells from further damage, including using drugs to reduce nerve cell death and lowering of the body's core temperature to reduce damage and improve functional outcome. Repair and regeneration—Encouraging the spinal cord to self-repair and stimulating the regrowth of nerve ﬁbers. These eﬀorts include exploring cell transplants, growth-promoting substances, and bioengineered growth scaﬀolds. Cell-based therapies—Replacing damaged nerve or support cells with other cell types, including stem cells, to jumpstart nerve cell growth and create new cell connections. Neuroplasticity—Retraining central nervous system circuits to restore body functions and form new nerve connections and pathways following injury or cell death through techniques like rehabilitation, electrical stimulation, robot-assisted training, and brain-computer interface technology that may help with voluntary muscle movement and coordination. Further research includes basic spinal cord function studies on how the spinal cord develops, processes sensory information, controls movement, and generates rhythmic patterns like walking and breathing. Studies using cells and animal models provide an essential foundation for developing interventions for spinal cord injury. And research on injury mechanisms focuses on what causes immediate harm and on the cascade of reactions the body deploys that protect from (or contribute to) secondary damage in the hours and days following a SCI This includes testing neuroprotective interventions in animal models.  Learn About Clinical Trials Clinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options. Search Clinical Trials The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Technologies® (BRAIN) Initiative brings multiple federal agencies and private organizations together to develop and apply new technologies to understand how complex circuits of nerve cells enable thinking, movement control, and perception. BRAIN’s SCI research includes: Exploring brain circuits to better understand the sensory and motor basis of behavior Next-generation neural prosthetics, or devices that connect to the nervous system and restore functions lost due to disease or injury Improved brain and spinal cord imaging New brain-computer interface devices NINDS also has developed Common Data Elements (CDEs) for SCI. CDEs are critical to ensure that data from clinical studies is collected and reported in a consistent way. More information about SCI research may be found using NIH RePORTER, a searchable database of current and past research projects supported by NIH and other federal agencies. RePORTER also includes links to publications and resources from these projects. For research articles and summaries on SCI, search PubMed, which contains citations from medical journals and other sites. How can I or my loved one help improve care for people with a spinal cord injury? Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about SCI. Clinical research uses human study participants to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps ﬁnd better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease. All types of study participants are needed—those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease—of all diﬀerent ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and eﬀective for everyone who will use them. For information about participating in clinical research visit NIH Clinical Research Trials and You. Learn about clinical trials currently looking for people with SCI at Clinicaltrials.gov, a searchable database of clinical trials. Spinal cord injury and rehabilitation research centers maintain registries of people interested in participating in ongoing or future clinical studies. A multi-site network supported by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation called the NeuroRecovery Network (NRN) accepts volunteer research participants. Signing up for the registry does not obligate a person to participate in a study. Registries are designed to help gather a list of potential participants that can be consulted as studies are initiated. Foreword

Experiencing a spinal cord injury is a life-changing 
event that can impact every aspect of the injured 
person’s life, and the lives of their family and 
friends. The injury, whether the result of trauma or 
disease, leads not only to impairment or loss of 
sensation and muscle movements, but also affects 
bladder, bowel, sexual function, as well as control 
over other vital organs. In addition to more obvious 
physical effects, the injury requires psychological 
adaptation and adjustment to cope with new life 
challenges; all of which can have profound effects 
on a person’s health and wellbeing, functioning, 
ability to participate in everyday activities and 
quality of life. A spinal cord injury also marks the start of an 
ongoing relationship between a patient and the 
healthcare system. In -,  people 
sustained a new serious spinal cord injury, and 
there were an estimated , people living with 
an existing spinal cord injury in NSW ( per 
million population), based on hospital records from 
onwards.* Effectively addressing the often complex, lifelong 
needs of people with a spinal cord injury involves 
an integrated network of services spanning acute 
and subacute rehabilitation and community 
settings. Across this continuum, there is a particular 
imperative to provide safe care – as we know that 
people with spinal cord injury are at particular risk 
of infections and other preventable, serious 
complications. We also know that improved patient 
outcomes are associated with timely access to 
evidence-based urgent, intensive medical and 
surgical care in the acute phase; availability of 
specialist facilities with expertly trained staff in the 
rehabilitation phase; and ongoing care and support 
in the community. Delivering the best spinal cord injury care in 
partnership with patients requires a system-wide 
effort. Key roles are played by supra local health 
district specialist services and by outreach and 
community-based services across the metropolitan 
and rural areas of the state. Integration across 
services, interagency collaboration, redesign 
methods and co-design will all play an important 
role in effective planning of services and delivery of 
care. Looking forward, improvements in clinical 
practice and patient outcomes will also rely on 
translational research and implementation science. 
Many trials of new technologies and therapies 
targeting neuroprotection, repair and restoration of 
function are underway worldwide. However, at this 
point in time, improvements in patient outcomes 
are optimised through participation in targeted 
specialist rehabilitation. It is clear that access to specialist rehabilitation is 
restricted by the total number of beds available, as 
well as inefficiencies in patient flow resulting from 
the National Disability Insurance Scheme and My 
Aged Care processes. This report highlights the need to redesign the way 
we deliver care to people with spinal cord injury in 
NSW to address current gaps, challenges and 
ensure equitable access to specialist care or 
specialist guided care. The potential to explore innovative models of care 
delivery, incorporating telehealth and specialist 
guided care, provides an opportunity to enhance 
system capacity.

Spinal cord injury refers to persistent damage to 
neural tissue and disruption of transmission along 
the nerves. A spinal cord injury can have a profound 
effect on a person’s functional status, ability to 
participate in daily activities and quality of life.  
A spinal cord injury also marks the start of an 
ongoing relationship with the healthcare system. In -, there were  people who 
experienced serious spinal cord injury. Overall, 
there is an estimated , people living with an 
existing spinal cord injury in NSW ( per million 
population).* Evidence on spinal cord injury  
in acute care 
There is good evidence that timely and direct 
admission to specialised care in an acute 
interdisciplinary spinal cord injury unit, is associated 
with better neurological outcomes, lower 
complication rates and reduced length of hospital 
stay. Decompression surgery should be undertaken 
in the first  hours following injury, and for many 
types of surgery, there is a strong relationship 
between the number of times a hospital performs a 
specific surgical procedure and the outcomes for 
patients. Specialised care in the acute phase has 
been shown to be more cost effective. Evidence on spinal cord injury  
in rehabilitation care 
Most people with spinal cord injury make significant 
functional gains during inpatient rehabilitation. 
Those initially cared for in interdisciplinary, specialist 
units achieve greater or faster functional gains 
during rehabilitation and specialised rehabilitation 
has been shown to be a significant and strong 
predictor of a patient returning home. There is some evidence of a ‘rehabilitation dose effect’ 
with improvements in motor Functional Independence 
Measure (FIM) positively associated with total hours of 
therapy (up to a certain time point). However, other 
studies found that the total amount of treatment 
received during rehabilitation was not associated 
with differences in patient outcomes. 
A  Victorian study demonstrated improvements 
in FIM motor scores among patients with nontraumatic spinal cord injury were greater for those in 
specialist rehabilitation units than for those in nonspecialist units. More recent data from the 
Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre 
(AROC) show that for key subgroups in NSW, relative 
functional gains are greater among those cared for in 
specialist centres. 
There is expert consensus that psychosocial 
rehabilitation should begin as soon as possible 
after admission to support patients to cope and 
adjust to life following the injury. Evidence on spinal cord injury  
in community care 
Education and support improve the confidence  
of rural clinicians in managing people with spinal 
cord injury. Rural key workers have been shown to be  
an effective support for local clinicians and  
service providers, improving communication  
and service coordination between rural and 
metropolitan services. Social participation of people with spinal cord injury 
is supported by adequate financial resources, 
accessible transportation and social support. Telehealth applications have been shown to 
provide support for improved self-management of 
common comorbidities. Multiple telehealth 
programs have been associated with positive 
results in perceived health and patient satisfaction. Summary Agency for Clinical Innovation

Utilisation of services in NSW There is increasing demand for healthcare 
services in NSW for people with spinal cord injury. 
The number of new serious spinal cord injury cases 
and all-cause hospitalisation of people with a history 
of serious spinal cord injury have increased in recent 
years. The number of specialist spinal cord injury 
centres and their capacity to provide inpatient care 
has, however, remained stable. Spinal cord injuries vary in severity and in the need 
for admission to specialist care. In -, there 
were  people admitted with a serious spinal 
cord injury, which is defined as first ever acute 
hospitalisation with a principal or additional 
diagnosis code for spinal cord injury and an  
acute length of stay of > days, or a rehabilitation 
stay of > days (Appendix ). Among these  patients,  (%) were 
admitted directly to one of the two specialist 
hospitals ( with a diagnosis code for tetraplegia 
or paraplegia and  with cauda equina). A further 
 patients (%) were initially admitted to a 
non-specialist hospital but were transferred to a 
specialist centre during their index hospitalisation 
( tetraplegia or paraplegia cases and  cauda 
equina cases). 
This means that  patients (%) with a serious 
spinal cord injury did not receive any care at a 
specialist hospital during their index hospitalisation. 
They were admitted across  non-specialist 
centres. At least  (%) of these patients would 
likely have benefitted from specialist services –  
patients with any type of tetraplegia, eight with 
complete paraplegia and  with cauda equina with 
bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. 
Better outcomes are associated with treatment in 
a specialist unit. Hospital-acquired complications 
are more common in patients who are transferred 
to specialist care after two days of acquiring a 
spinal cord injury. Gaps in spinal cord injury care Improved access to specialist care is required. 
Despite recent increases in outreach support for 
non-specialist units, there remains a need for more 
specialist and specialist-guided services. There are a lack of data and information about 
unwarranted clinical variation across different 
healthcare providers. Care for people with spinal 
cord injury is delivered by a range of professionals, 
units and hospitals, spanning from highly 
specialised technical care to routine services. There 
are few validated metrics that are clinically 
relevant, scientifically robust and operationally 
feasible to assess variation in care. 
An evidence-informed review of admission 
criteria and referral pathways for people with 
spinal cord injury would guide improvement and 
help ensure early access to the most appropriate 
care. Greater clarity around patient pathways and 
admission criteria support delivery of the right care, 
in the right place, at the right time. There are 
potential gains to be made through innovative 
approaches to the provision of care, such as 
telehealth, clinical decision support systems and the 
use of predictive analytics. The extent to which funding, based on the 
national weighted activity units, supports the 
range and complexity of care provided to people 
with SCI is worthy of review. There is a need to 
better understand the application of activity-based 
funding to spinal episodes across the continuum of 
care, with a special focus on cost drivers for acute 
and subacute care. * This is an underestimate of the total number of people living 
with an existing spinal cord injury in NSW. It does not include 
people who had a spinal cord injury prior to and no 
subsequent hospital episode from onwards with the 
spinal cord injury noted in the hospital record. A study by New et 
al. estimates that the prevalence of traumatic spinal cord injury in 
Australia is between  and  per million population and 
including non-traumatic spinal cord injury would make it higher.

The spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum, 
the opening at the base of the skull, to the conus 
medullaris, the most distal bulbous part of the cord at 
the level of the first and second lumbar vertebrae. The 
spinal cord transmits neural information between the 
brain and the rest of the body and integrates this 
information to enable voluntary initiation of body 
movement and regulation of autonomic functions, 
such as blood pressure and respiration. 
Spinal cord injury refers to persistent damage to 
neural tissue and disruption of transmission along 
the nerves. About two-thirds of injuries are a result 
of trauma (e.g. motor vehicle accidents or falls) and 
the remaining one-third are non-traumatic 
(resulting from non-progressive disease processes, 
such as infection, haemorrhage, ischaemia, 
inflammation [myelitis] or spinal canal stenosis). 
The injury causes loss of sensation and movement, 
as well as disruption to internal organ function, 
including bowel, bladder, and sexual impairments. 
It can have profound effects on patients’ functional 
status, ability to participate in the activities of daily 
living and quality of life. Spinal cord injuries are commonly categorised into 
complete tetraplegia, incomplete tetraplegia, 
complete paraplegia and incomplete paraplegia, 
and unspecified cauda equina (Appendix ). 
Four phases of care for spinal cord injury span: 
. Pre-hospital – stabilisation of vital functions 
and preservation of neurological function. . Acute – prioritising and treating injuries to minimise 
impairment, pain and psychological suffering. . Sub-acute – inpatient rehabilitation  enhancing 
function, compensating for loss of function, 
preventing complications, assisting with 
emotional adjustment. . Community reintegration and ongoing care 
– promoting health and wellbeing, social 
inclusion and participation. Introduction and background A spinal cord injury marks the start of an ongoing 
relationship between the healthcare system and 
the person with spinal cord injury, as they progress 
through acute, rehabilitation and community 
phases. Patient flows are complex and many

.   Health and healthcare databases  
and analysis Quantitative data were drawn from: 
• NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection; 
Emergency Department Data Collection; 
Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, 
accessed via Hospital Performance Data, NSW 
Ministry of Health Secure Analytics for 
Population Health Research and Intelligence. 
• Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes  
Centre reports. 
• Spinal Cord Injury Database and State Spinal 
Cord Injury Service (SSCIS) reports – includes 
incident cases for traumatic and non-traumatic 
spinal cord injury in NSW for patients who are 
admitted to the specialist spinal units and 
readmissions by this cohort. • Royal North Shore Plastics Service Report . A pseudo-registry was constructed to estimate the 
prevalence of spinal cord injury patients in NSW. Using 
a -year lookback, all hospital records were searched 
for a diagnosis code indicating a spinal cord injury 
(Appendix ). Presence of a qualifying code triggered 
inclusion of the patient in the registry, regardless of 
where the code occurred in the record (i.e. principal 
diagnosis or additional diagnosis -). Serious index 
cases were defined as first ever acute hospitalisation 
with a spinal cord injury diagnosis code and an acute 
length of stay over five days; or a rehabilitation stay 
over  days. Throughout this report, a hospitalisation 
refers to a contiguous set of hospital episodes, including 
transfers between hospitals and changes in care type. .  Patient surveys In -, an online survey was distributed via 
the two key community groups, Spinal Cord Injuries 
Australia (SCIA) and ParaQuad NSW. 
.  Patient stories 
A representative sample of people with spinal cord 
injury at specialist services were asked by spinal 
cord injury clinicians to contribute stories about 
their experiences of care. 
.  Patient and clinician consultation In , Nexus Management Consultants on behalf 
of the State Spinal Cord Injury Service (SSCIS) 
conducted: •  face-to-face interviews with people with 
spinal cord injury • six site visits involving interviews with inpatients 
and clinicians • meetings with community organisations,  
SCIA and ParaQuad NSW. More than  clinicians were consulted about 
current delivery models and operational 
arrangements; approaches to continuous 
improvement, and involvement in benchmarking; 
the effectiveness of current approaches; groups of 
patients/consumers for whom specific strategies 
are required; and priorities for service 
development. Aboriginal Impact Statement In order to assess spinal cord injury from an 
Aboriginal perspective, the analyses included in 
this report were conducted with Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal groups. The proportion of both 
spinal cord injury index and total hospitalisation 
patients, who identified as Aboriginal, was about 
%. This is a similar proportion to that of the NSW 
population who identify as Aboriginal (.%). 
There have not been separately reported in this 
document, given the low numbers, to maintain 
confidentiality of those individuals. The Aboriginal Impact Statement conducted in 
 recognised that existing services are not well 
designed to accommodate the special cultural and 
community needs of Aboriginal people and may 
result in poor outcomes. Further work will need to 
be done in this area and is underway with other 
ACI networks. Agency for Clinical Innovation

‘What works’ in spinal cord injury care Systematic reviews and evidence-based guidance 
regarding spinal cord injuries are published by a 
range of international bodies, such as The Spinal 
Cord Injury Research Evidence initiative, and the 
Congress of Neurological Surgeons.,  
Recent articles in the peer reviewed literature have 
addressed controversial areas of practice in the 
treatment of spinal cord injury, including the use of 
corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone 
sodium succinate, the optimal timing of surgical 
intervention, the type and timing of anticoagulation 
prophylaxis, the role of magnetic resonance 
imaging, and the type and timing of rehabilitation. 
This report focuses primarily on healthcare  
delivery arrangements rather than therapeutic and 
clinical decisions. 
The research evidence gathering process focused 
on four questions: 
. What works in acute care? 
. What works in rehabilitation? 
. What works in primary and community care? 
. What is cost effective care for people with 
spinal cord injury? A summary of key consensus statements for high 
quality care for patients with spinal cord injury is 
shown below in Table . The research evidence Key consensus statements defining high quality care for patients with spinal cord injury All patients with spinal cord injury admitted to hospital should have a written care plan that outlines: • management of autonomic dysreflexia for patients at risk (Tor above) • respiratory management to prevent or treat chest complications • commencing thromboembolic prophylaxis if immobilised with bed rest or admitted for medical illness or surgery • preventive measures to avoid pressure sores • adequate nutrition • bowel and bladder management program • management of spasticity and avoidance of secondary musculoskeletal complications. 
Rehabilitation should: • be offered to patients with acute spinal cord injury when they are medically stable and can tolerate required 
rehabilitation intensity 
• incorporate psychosocial support. All patients with spinal cord injury admitted to hospital should have appropriate discharge planning involving: 
• the patient and his/her family and carers • relevant members of the multidisciplinary team • direct contact with the community care team. 
The following should be in place before discharge: 
• arrangements for transport, care and equipment needs • full reports from all professionals involved with their care • appropriate transport arrangements made for future outpatient or review appointments. Table : Summary of recommendations for high quality spinal cord injury care

What works in acute care? There is increasing evidence to show that timely 
and direct admission to specialised care is 
associated with better neurological outcomes, lower 
complication rates, and reduced length of stay.
More specifically, the latest guidance suggests 
decompression surgery should be undertaken in the 
 hours following spinal cord injury. What works in rehabilitation? 
Most people with spinal cord injury make significant 
functional gains during inpatient rehabilitation. 
Those initially cared for in specialist units have been 
shown to achieve more or faster gains during 
rehabilitation. Receiving specialised rehabilitation 
has been shown to be a significant and strong 
predictor of returning home. Some studies have found a ‘rehabilitation dose 
effect’ with improvements in motor Functional 
Independence Measure (FIM) positively associated 
with total hours of therapy (up to a certain time 
point). However, other studies found that the total 
amount of treatment received during rehabilitation 
was not associated with differences in patient 
outcomes. A Victorian study found that for people with nontraumatic spinal cord injury, improvements in FIM 
motor scores in specialist spinal cord injury 
rehabilitation units were better than those in nonspecialist units. Psychosocial rehabilitation is associated with better 
outcomes, particularly when it is initiated as soon 
as possible after admission, subject to the patient’s 
medical condition and cognitive status. Qualitative studies of patient perspectives suggest 
that the skills and vision of rehabilitation staff are 
considered to be of crucial importance. What works in community care? Telehealth has been shown to improve selfmanagement of common comorbidities. Multiple 
telehealth programs have been associated with 
positive results in perceived health and patient 
satisfaction (although there are no proven links  
to outcomes). 
Education and support improves the confidence  
of rural clinicians in managing people with spinal 
cord injury. Rural key workers have been shown to be  
effective support for local clinicians and service 
providers, improving communication and service 
coordination between rural and metropolitan  
spinal cord injury services. 
Adequate financial resources, accessible 
transportation and social support helps facilitate  
patient social participation. Physical accessibility 
issues, unsupportive social attitudes and mental 
health issues have been shown to be barriers  
to community participation. What is cost-effective care? 
Specialised care, particularly in the acute phase 
has been shown to be more cost effective. 
Similarly, early surgical decompression is more cost 
effective than delayed surgery. For elderly patients, surgical management and 
rehabilitation of acute traumatic cervical spinal 
cord injury is more costly, but similarly effective  
when compared with younger adults with  
similar impairment. Despite a relatively high initial cost, specialist 
rehabilitation has been shown to be cost-efficient, 
producing savings in ongoing care, costs, and 
relieving pressure on acute care services.

Specialist services for adults 
Table  shows provision of care for adults with a 
spinal cord injury is centred at two specialist acute 
units at  Prince of Wales and Royal North Shore 
hospitals and two specialist rehabilitation units at 
Prince of Wales Hospital and Royal Rehab. There are 
 specialist acute adult beds and  specialist adult 
rehabilitation beds. Specialist units have wheelchair 
accessible physical facilities and specialised ward 
equipment. They can draw on the services of the 
host facility – including intensive care, urology, plastic 
surgery, pain management, infectious diseases, 
respiratory and renal medicine services. For admission to a specialist spinal cord injury 
service in NSW, a person must have a persistent 
spinal cord injury resulting from either a traumatic 
injury or a non-progressive disease. Priority is given 
to people with complex needs, based on criteria 
such as the level and extent of neurological injury to 
the spinal cord; the complexity of care; the presence 
of comorbid conditions and/or functional limitations; 
and the need for highly specialised treatment, 
services and expertise. 
As well as inpatient care, specialist centres also 
provide highly specialised networked services  
such as adult outpatient and community outreach 
across the state. Networked services are funded by 
a service agreement between the local health 
district (LHD) and the service provider.

Outpatient and community services 
for non-admitted patients Prince of Wales Hospital provides a specialist 
multidisciplinary spinal outpatient clinic. Royal 
North Shore Hospital and Royal Rehab offer 
medical outpatient appointments, with variable 
access to specialised staff from other disciplines 
(Table ). Community-based services  
The Spinal Outreach Service (SOS) provides  
specialist multidisciplinary support, education and 
clinical interventions to patients following their 
discharge from hospital. Services aim to maintain 
health and promote community integration. There 
are separate metropolitan and rural SOS programs. 
Hunter New England LHD hosts the Hunter Spinal 
Cord Injury Service (HSCIS), a community-based 
service for people in the Hunter and Lower  
Mid North Coast Region. HSCIS provide 
multidisciplinary therapy after discharge from 
specialist or non-specialist units and life-long  
health services. Outpatient clinics are delivered  
in collaboration with John Hunter Hospital 
Rehabilitation Medicine services. Rural spinal outreach service 
The Rural Spinal Cord Injury Service links rural 
areas with the spinal cord injury units, providing 
specialist multidisciplinary care to people living 
outside metropolitan Sydney. It also provides 
education sessions to rural clinicians. It is funded 
through the Rural Outreach Fund. 
The rural service is based on a ‘hub and spoke’ 
model. Rural coordinators are supported locally by 
the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Program, conveyed 
through service level agreements, with spinal cord 
injury-specific support and linkages provided by the 
SOS in Sydney. 
Each year, nine specialist medical and multidisciplinary 
day clinics are held in different regional centres for 
people with spinal cord injury (Appendix ). Table : Specialty clinics for spinal cord injury,  
by hospital Specialist services for children 
Sydney Children’s Hospital and The Children’s Hospital 
Westmead provide services for acute, subacute and 
ambulatory care. Upon discharge, children are referred 
to the Paediatric Spinal Outreach Service, managed 
by Northcott Disability Services. Nursing, occupational 
therapy, physiotherapy and social work services are 
provided in the community, and staff liaise with local 
providers. Outpatient services are also available 
through the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network and 
Hunter New England HNEkidsRehab Services.

In -, there were  patients with an index 
hospitalisation for a serious spinal cord injury, an 
increase from  patients in -. The number 
of patients admitted to a specialist unit was fairly 
stable over the time period, ranging from  to  
each year, while the number admitted to a nonspecialist unit ranged from  to  each year

There are four pathways that patients follow during 
their index hospitalisation. In -:

hospital •  (%) were admitted to a non-specialist hospital 
and transferred to a specialist hospital in less 
than two days •  (%) were admitted to non-specialist and 
transferred to specialist after two or more days 
•  (%) were admitted to and remained at a 
non-specialist hospital (Figure ). 
Patients who have one of the following injuries 
should be prioritised (due to complexity) for 
admission to a spinal cord injuries unit, or if there is 
insufficient bed capacity, provided access to 
specialist care due to complexity: • tetraplegia (complete, incomplete, or unspecified) • paraplegia complete • cauda equina with bowel and/or bladder 
problems. For patients who were admitted to, and remained 
in, non-specialist care,  (%) should have 
received some input from specialist care based on 
their injury and its complexity (Figure ). This is 
likely to underestimate the need, given that the 
groups containing patients with incomplete or 
unspecified paraplegia will include complex cases 
that should also be prioritised for specialist care. Those patients whose transfer to specialist care 
was delayed for more than two days, had a longer 
length of stay (median  days) compared to all 
other pathways (median  days or less). Index hospitalisations in NSW Figure : Index hospitalisations for serious spinal cord injury by admission to specialist and

hospital care provided for people with spinal cord 
injury – both in the acute phase and for ongoing 
care. It also raises questions about associations 
between quality and volume. It is well established 
that, for many types of surgery, there is a strong 
relationship between the number of times a 
hospital (or a team, or a surgeon) performs a 
specific surgical procedure and the outcomes for 
patients. While minimum volumes are not well 
delineated for spinal cord surgery or for hyperacute care, such highly specialised services 
generally benefit from a minimum volume of cases. Agency for Clinical Innovation

Caring for spinal cord injury patients requires a 
range of specialist services varying in breadth and 
intensity. Internationally, spinal cord injury services 
deliver those services using an organisational 
model that centres on dedicated beds. 
Although dedicated beds allow for the delivery of 
complex care, they are often a scarce resource. 
Any delays in discharging patients from a bed can 
have a knock-on effect, preventing other patients 
from accessing the most appropriate care. 
A ‘snapshot’ approach to gauge the extent of 
delays in spinal cord injury services showed that 
on  December , among the  specialist 
beds available across the state,  had patients 
who were ready for discharge and  waiting to be 
admitted (Figure ). For the patients ready for discharge, the median 
wait was  days at Prince of Wales,  days at 
Royal North Shore, and  days at Royal Rehab. 
The reasons for waiting included delays in 
availability of accommodation and National 
Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) approvals 
(Figure ). Patient flows and specialist beds Agency for Clinical Innovation

Rehabilitation services for people with spinal cord 
injury span a range of specialist and nonspecialist, public and private facilities. 
Patients can have substantial delays in specialist 
acute care beds waiting to transition to 
rehabilitation care. In -, the median wait for 
patients accessing specialist units was  days 
(range one to  days). In , there were  rehabilitation episodes for 
spinal cord injury patients. Of these,  (%) 
occurred in specialist rehabilitation units,  
(%) in non-specialist public rehabilitation units, 
and  (%) in private units. 
Between  and , the number of 
rehabilitation episodes in public units (both 
specialist and non-specialist) increased from  
to  (Figure ). 
For patients with spinal cord injury, change in 
functional status is an important outcome 
measure. For most spinal cord injuries, patients 
achieve higher functional gains in specialist 
rehabilitation units compared with non-specialist 
units (Figure ).  
At the end of the rehabilitation phase, some 
patients experience substantial delays for nonhealth related reasons such as funding for 
accommodation, care and equipment needs. On  June , there were four patients ready 
for discharge at Prince of Wales Hospital and  
patients at Royal Rehab (with median waits up to 
that date of . and . days respectively).  
On  December , this increased to  
patients (median wait  days) and  patients 
(median wait  days) at Prince of Wales and 
Royal Rehab respectively.

Figure : Re-hospitalisations by people with established spinal cord injury to specialist spinal cord injury 
units, total and selected principal diagnoses, to Data on discharge destinations provide some 
insight into the extent to which patients are 
supported to go home, and the proportion of 
patients who are discharged to nursing homes – 
which are not well suited to meet the needs of 
people with spinal cord injury. Between 
and -, the number of patients discharged 
from a specialist unit to a nursing home increased 
from  to , from % to % of patients discharged 
after initial care and from % to % of discharged 
rehabilitation patients (Figure ). 
People with spinal cord injury are at risk of a range 
of complications, including pneumonia, autonomic 
dysreflexia, blood clots, pressure injuries, urinary 
and bowel problems, and depression. 
"Every time I try to make it all work for myself I 
get another pressure injury and end up back in 
hospital. I can’t do anything whilst I am in 
hospital. It affects my work and I just got the 
promotion I wanted. I’ve been working towards 
this promotion for years and now I have to tell 
my employer that I need a minimum two months 
off work. This is awkward for me as a new 
manager and makes me look bad."   
– Person with spinal cord injury. While some hospitalisations for these complications 
are unavoidable, many are potentially preventable 
with effective community and primary care. In -, there were  re-hospitalisations for 
complications to specialist units among people 
with established spinal cord injury, an increase 
from  in (Figure ). In -, the 
median length of stay for hospitalisation was eight 
days (range days). The three main types of complications were

Patient and carer perspectives on spinal cord injury 
care are essential to understand what is working 
well in current delivery arrangements and where 
there may be gaps in meeting their physical, 
mental, emotional and social needs. 
In -, an online survey was completed by  
people living with spinal cord injury. They provided 
feedback on many aspects of care and support in 
various settings (Figure ).   
For most respondents, care and treatment while in 
hospital was led by a health professional (%) and 
was well coordinated (%). However, % of 
respondents reported that care from different 
clinicians and parts of the hospital was not well 
coordinated. While in rehabilitation, % of 
respondents said they were involved in goal-setting 
and % said their rehabilitation goals were 
achieved or mostly achieved. Transition to living in 
the community was the aspect of care with the 
highest proportion of negative experiences. 
In this aspect, % of respondents reported no 
nominated worker to lead and coordinate the 
transition to the community, % reported no 
follow-up post discharge, and % felt they were 
inadequately prepared for living in the community. People with spinal cord injury were also asked to 
contribute stories about their experiences of care at 
Prince of Wales Spinal Unit, Royal North Shore Spinal 
Unit, Royal Rehab, and the Spinal Outreach Service. 
Peter’s story highlights the importance of specialist 
rehabilitation, the Spinal Outreach Service and 
financial support to live well with a spinal cord 
injury at home and in the community. In contrast, 
some patients commented on a lack of financial 
support to live at home and the distress caused by 
having stay in hospital or at an aged care facility. 
Tom’s story reflects how the coordinated approach 
within the specialist units is often not available in 
generalist facilities.

Figure : Spinal cord injury patient stories Peter’s story Peter is a -year-old man who sustained a 
complete C (tetraplegia) spinal cord injury after 
falling from a third-floor balcony. Peter was taken by 
ambulance to the spinal specialist trauma centre. 
After a comprehensive assessment by the trauma 
team, he was transferred to the operating theatre 
for early surgical decompression and stabilisation. 
This was followed by seven days of intensive care. 
Peter was then transferred to the acute spinal cord 
injury unit where he spent five weeks. He initially 
struggled with his breathing and was unable to 
move his arms and legs. He often felt overwhelmed 
by his injury. Peter found it difficult to accept that 
he would not be able to walk again or return to his 
normal job as a builder, and would need to move 
back in with his parents to support his daily living. 
When medically stable, Peter was transferred to the 
spinal cord injury rehabilitation unit where he spent 
 weeks. The focus was on achieving his goals to 
enable him to return to life in the community. Peter 
underwent daily rehabilitation to improve mobility 
and independence and attended group learning 
activities with other patients, family members and 
peer support workers and the vocational 
rehabilitation counsellors. He also made initial 
contact with the Spinal Outreach Service (SOS). 
After approval of the NDIS package and other 
support arrangements, Peter was discharged to his 
parents’ home. He received follow-up care from the 
SOS, referral to mainstream services, and calls from 
the vocational consultant and peer support worker. 
Peter quickly adapted to life in the community with 
support and encouragement from his family, 
friends, specialist care team and his preferred GP 
and primary healthcare team. The construction 
firm he had worked for prior to injury supported his 
return to part-time work and provided funding for 
him to re-train in building project management. 
Tom's story Tom had a fall resulting in a C incomplete spinal 
cord injury. He was taken to a nearby hospital and 
operated on. He was put on the waiting list to 
transfer to the Spinal Injuries Unit in Sydney for 
rehabilitation, but had to wait six weeks for a bed to 
become available. The staff in the neurosurgery 
ward were great, but they were not sure how best 
to care for Tom and had to contact the Spinal ward 
regularly for advice and guidance. 
Once transferred to the spinal unit, Tom felt 
reassured because the staff knew how to look after 
him and had better equipment. He also got a lot of 
support from other patients, especially in the 
rehabilitation gym. It was difficult being far from 
home, and his wife and children could only visit on 
weekends, but he felt like he was getting the best 
care possible.  
After finishing his spinal specific rehabilitation, Tom 
was transferred back to a local rehabilitation facility 
to be closer to his family. However, he felt abandoned 
there because they did not have a power wheelchair 
for him. Tom had to hire one from a local supplier and 
it took a week to arrive. He felt like he knew more 
about his needs than the staff did. 
Once Tom’s own equipment arrived, carers were 
organised and his home modified, he was discharged 
home. His wife helped him until all of his care became 
available. He did not receive any follow up care from 
the spinal unit and is not sure if he will be able to go 
back to work. He finds it helpful to talk to other 
patients from the Spinal Cord Injury Unit but wishes 
he could access the support they receive in Sydney. Agency for Clinical Innovation

Through a series of interviews conducted by Nexus 
Management, clinicians were asked to describe 
what works best across the care continuum for 
people with spinal cord injury. 
The clinicians described how the profound, lifechanging consequences associated with spinal 
cord injury can be addressed or compensated for 
with the right access to specialist support, services 
and equipment. 
Comprehensive care across life stages requires 
ongoing access to highly specialised services,  
with an interdisciplinary approach to addressing 
medical, physical, functional, psychological, social,  
vocational and leisure issues. The complex mix of 
interdependent services described below currently 
exist within the specialist services and are generally 
not available at the non-specialist services. 
• Regular, periodic specialised medical assessment 
of complex comorbid multisystem problems 
related to the injury, including planned medical 
interventions, surgery and specialised 
investigations performed in hospital, such as 
overnight sleep studies. • Hospital beds for planned and unplanned 
admissions. • Subspecialty consultations, including cardiology, 
endocrine, gastroenterology, neurosurgery, 
orthopaedics, pain management, plastic surgery, 
psychiatry, respiratory medicine, upper limb 
reconstructive surgery and urology. • Expert nursing staff and clinical nurse  
educators to: − 
assist the individual and family/carers to learn 
about their health condition − 
adapt to a new lifestyle and develop selfmanagement skills for self-care activities of 
daily living and health maintenance in line 
with their changed abilities and limitations. • Occupational therapy staff who: − 
review and prescribe appropriate and  
tailored adaptive equipment (e.g. activities  
of daily living  devices, splints, wheelchair  
and cushion) − 
carry out home assessments and recommend 
modifications to enable the person to live 
independently − 
prescribe specialised assistive technologies, 
including environmental control systems, to 
support the person with impaired function to 
live in their own home. • Physiotherapy staff who: − 
optimise the individual’s physical performance 
and independence for mobility in everyday 
living and community access (including  
respiratory management and orthotic 
prescription) − 
provide education and therapy to reduce the 
long-term risk of overuse injuries, and 
optimise function as a person ages. Clinician perspectives on  
best practice management Agency for Clinical Innovation 
www.aci.health.nsw.gov.au Evidence and utilisation of spinal cord injury services in NSW 
  August 
• Social workers and clinical psychologists to 
provide counseling, family therapy, individual 
psychotherapy, and training to develop selfmanagement and coping skills to assist with 
dealing with life challenges, mood and 
adjustment disorders. • A therapeutic recreation specialist to: − 
assist patients develop leisure skills − 
eliminate barriers to participation − 
use leisure activities as a way to promote 
health, functioning and quality of life in the 
community. • A range of other specialist spinal cord injury 
service providers, such as dietitians, 
rehabilitation engineers, orthotists, vocational 
rehabilitation counselors and assistive 
technology specialists. • Trained peers with spinal cord injury who can 
provide a unique form of support, 
encouragement, role modeling and mentoring, 
complementing the care from the treating health 
professional team. • Appropriately trained carers with skills and 
knowledge in prevention and early intervention 
of complications and/or the ability to support the 
individual to initiate timely healthcare review. It’s really important that all of the staff from 
surgical dressers and therapists, to the doctors 
and nurses, work well together and talk to each 
other to make sure that things don’t go wrong.

Acute care 
The goals of acute care in spinal cord injury patients 
are to optimise survival rates, enhance functional 
recovery and reduce complications by providing 
evidence-based specialist care in a specialist unit 
and/or by providing multidisciplinary in-reach 
support where spinal cord injury unit beds are  
not available. Research evidence: Specialist acute care is 
associated with better patient outcomes. Research evidence: Early surgery (in the first  
hours) is recommended and associated with better 
patient outcomes. Guidelines: All patients with spinal cord injury 
admitted to hospital should have a written care plan 
that outlines (among other requirements) 
prophylaxis for thromboembolism, respiratory care, 
bladder and bowel programmes, diligent skin care 
to prevent pressure injury, and adequate nutrition. The following data outline the current gaps in  
acute care: 
• In -,  of the  people (%) who 
had a serious spinal cord injury did not access 
specialist spinal cord injury care during their 
index hospitalisation. • Of the  index cases transferred to a specialist 
spinal cord injury unit in -, the majority 
( patients, %) occurred outside of the 
recommended transfer guidelines. 
• Currently there are  specialist acute beds in 
NSW. Additional patients may warrant 
admission to an acute specialist unit each year. • Non-specialist hospitals lack the necessary 
range and scope of skills, staff and equipment to 
manage people who meet the criteria for 
admission to a specialist unit, but cannot be 
admitted due to lack of bed availability. • In -,  of the  patients with a 
serious spinal cord injury had a spinal 
decompression or spinal fusion procedure during 
their index hospitalisation. The date of the 
procedure was available for  patients. Of 
these  patients,  (%) had the procedure 
on the same day as admission or one day after 
admission. Patients were more likely to receive 
the procedure in a timely manner if admitted 
directly to a specialist hospital ( out of , % 
[four with unknown procedure date]) compared 
with patients who received non-specialist care 
only ( out of , % [ with unknown 
procedure date]). 
• Patients are often occupying specialist acute 
beds waiting to transition to rehabilitation. In 
-, the median delay was  days (range 
days). 
• In -, there were , acute overnight 
hospitalisations by people with a history of 
serious spinal cord injury. Most of these (%) 
occurred in a non-specialist hospital. There were 
 non-specialist hospitals that admitted fewer 
than  patients for acute overnight care. Rehabilitation care Research evidence: Most people with spinal cord 
injury make significant functional gains during 
inpatient rehabilitation. Those initially cared for in 
interdisciplinary, specialist units achieve more or 
faster functional gains during rehabilitation. Research evidence: There is some evidence of a 
dose effect with rehabilitation – more rehabilitation 
is associated with better outcomes (based on FIM 
gains), up to a point/ceiling. 
Research evidence: For patients with non-traumatic 
spinal cord injury, those admitted into specialist units 
had greater functional improvements during 
rehabilitation. This may also be true for patients with 
traumatic spinal cord injury. Current gaps in spinal cord injury care Agency for Clinical Innovation 
www.aci.health.nsw.gov.au Evidence and utilisation of spinal cord injury services in NSW 
  August 
Guidelines: Rehabilitation should be offered to 
patients with acute spinal cord injury when they are 
medically stable and can tolerate the required 
rehabilitation intensity. Guidelines: All hospitalised patients with spinal 
cord injury should have appropriate discharge 
planning involving: 
• the patient and his or her family and carers • relevant members of the multidisciplinary team • direct contact with the community care team. Guidelines: The following should be in place before 
discharge: • care plans for psychosocial care • arrangements for transport, care and  
equipment needs • full reports from all professionals involved with 
patients’ care • appropriate arrangements made for future 
outpatient or review appointments. The following data point to current gaps in 
rehabilitation: • In ,  of  rehabilitation episodes (%) 
occurred in non-specialist rehabilitation units. 
For most classes of traumatic and non-traumatic 
spinal cord injury, patients achieve higher 
functional gains in specialist rehabilitation units 
compared with non-specialist units. • For many patients who are clinically ready to 
transition to living in the community, there are 
substantial delays waiting for suitable 
accommodation and modifications. For example, 
on the  December , for patients ready for 
discharge from rehabilitation at Prince of Wales 
and Royal Rehab, the median wait was  days 
and  days respectively. • Nursing homes are not well suited to meet the 
needs of people with spinal cord injury. Between 
and -, the number of patients 
discharged from a specialist unit to a nursing 
home increased from  to  (from % to % of 
patients discharged after initial care and from 
% to % of discharged rehabilitation patients). Community care Research evidence: Rural clinician confidence is 
improved by training. Research evidence: Telehealth is an effective way 
to provide support to people with spinal cord injury 
living in the community. 
Research evidence: Internationally, there is 
evidence of unmet health needs among individuals 
living with spinal cord injury in the community. Research evidence: Routine, comprehensive, 
specialist follow-up services can result in  
improved health. The following data point to current gaps in 
community care: • In -, there were  re-hospitalisations to 
specialist units for complications among people 
with established spinal cord injury. While not all 
complications are avoidable, some are potentially 
preventable with appropriate community and 
primary care. 
• People living in the Sydney metropolitan area and 
Illawarra Shoalhaven area, do not have access to 
similar level of lifelong multidisciplinary follow up 
for health promotion and early intervention 
offered by Rural Spinal Cord Injury Service. • In the first nine months of , demand for the 
Rural Spinal Cord Injury Service exceeded 
capacity and almost % of referred patients 
were unable to access care.

Recent advances in medical management of SCI has signiﬁcantly improved diagnosis, stabilization, survival rate and well-being of SCI patients. However, there has been small progress on treatment options for improving the neurological outcomes of SCI patients. This incremental success mainly reﬂects the complexity of SCI pathophysiology and the diverse biochemical and physiological changes that occur in the injured spinal cord. Therefore, in the past few decades, considerable efforts have been made by SCI researchers to elucidate the pathophysiology of SCI and unravel the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue degeneration and repair in the injured spinal cord. To this end, a number of preclinical animal and injury models have been developed to more closely recapitulate the primary and secondary injury processes of SCI. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of SCI. We will also discuss the neurological outcomes of human SCI and the available experimental model systems that have been employed to identify SCI mechanisms and develop therapeutic strategies for this condition. Keywords: spinal cord injury, secondary injury mechanisms, clinical classiﬁcations and demography, animal models, glial and immune response, glial scar, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), cell death INTRODUCTION Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurological condition with tremendous socioeconomic impact on aﬀected individuals and the health care system. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, there are , new cases of SCI each year in North America (). Etiologically, more than % of SCI cases are traumatic and caused by incidences such as traﬃc accidents, violence, sports or falls (). There is a reported male-to-female ratio of : for SCI, which happens more frequently in adults compared to children (). Demographically, men are mostly aﬀected during their early and late adulthood (rd and th decades of life) (), while women are at higher risk during their adolescence (– years) and th decade of their lives (). The age distribution is bimodal, with a ﬁrst peak involving young adults and a second peak involving adults over the age of  (). Adults older than  years of age whom suﬀer SCI have considerably worse outcomes than younger patients, and their injuries usually result from falls and age-related bony changes (). Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury The clinical outcomes of SCI depend on the severity and location of the lesion and may include partial or complete loss of sensory and/or motor function below the level of injury. Lower thoracic lesions can cause paraplegia while lesions at cervical level are associated with quadriplegia (). SCI typically aﬀects the cervical level of the spinal cord (%) with the single most common level aﬀected being C (). Other injuries include the thoracic level (%) and lumbar region (%). With recent advancements in medical procedures and patient care, SCI patients often survive these traumatic injuries and live for decades after the initial injury (). Reports on the clinical outcomes of patients who suﬀered SCI between  and 
in Australia demonstrated that survival rates for those suﬀering from tetraplegia and paraplegia is . and .%, respectively (). The -year survival rate of these individuals was  and % for persons with tetraplegia and paraplegia, respectively (). The life expectancy of SCI patients highly depends on the level of injury and preserved functions. For instance, patients with ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade D who require a wheelchair for daily activities have an estimated % of a normal life expectancy, while patients who do not require wheelchair and catheterization can have a higher life expectancy up to % of a normal individual (). Today, the estimated life-time cost of a SCI patient is $. million per patient (). Therefore, it is critical to unravel the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SCI and develop new eﬀective treatments for this devastating condition. Over the past decades, a wealth of research has been conducted in preclinical and clinical SCI with the hope to ﬁnd new therapeutic targets for traumatic SCI. An Overview of Primary Injury SCI commonly results from a sudden, traumatic impact on the spine that fractures or dislocates vertebrae. The initial mechanical forces delivered to the spinal cord at the time of injury is known as primary injury where “displaced bone fragments, disc materials, and/or ligaments bruise or tear into the spinal cord tissue” (–). Notably, most injuries do not completely sever the spinal cord (). Four main characteristic mechanisms of primary injury have been identiﬁed that include: () Impact plus persistent compression; () Impact alone with transient compression; () Distraction; () Laceration/transection (, ). The most common form of primary injury is impact plus persistent compression, which typically occurs through burst fractures with bone fragments compressing the spinal cord or through fracture-dislocation injuries (, , ). Impact alone with transient compression is observed less frequently but most commonly in hyperextension injuries (). Distraction injuries occur when two adjacent vertebrae are pulled apart causing the spinal column to stretch and tear in the axial plane (, ). Lastly, laceration and transection injuries can occur through missile injuries, severe dislocations, or sharp bone fragment dislocations and can vary greatly from minor injuries to complete transection (). There are also distinct diﬀerences between the outcomes of SCI in military and civilian cases. Compared to civilian SCI, blast injury is the common cause of SCI in battleﬁeld that usually involves multiple segments of the spinal cord (). Blast SCI also results in higher severity scores and is associated with longer hospital stays (). A study on American military personnel, who sustained SCI in a combat zone from  to , showed increased severity and poorer neurological recovery compared to civilian SCI (). Moreover, lower lumbar burst fractures and lumbosacral dissociation happen more frequently in combat injuries (). Regardless of the form of primary injury, these forces directly damage ascending and descending pathways in the spinal cord and disrupt blood vessels and cell membranes (, ) causing spinal shock, systemic hypotension, vasospasm, ischemia, ionic imbalance, and neurotransmitter accumulation (). To date, the most eﬀective clinical treatment to limit tissue damage following primary injury is the early surgical decompression (< h post-injury) of the injured spinal cord (, ). Overall, the extent of the primary injury determines the severity and outcome of SCI (, ). An Overview on Clinical Classiﬁcation Systems for Spinal Cord Injury Functional classiﬁcation of SCI has been developed to establish reproducible scoring systems by which the severity of SCI could be measured, compared, and correlated with the clinical outcomes (). Generally, SCI can be classiﬁed as either complete or incomplete. In complete SCI, neurological assessments show no spared motor or sensory function below the level of injury (). In the past decades, several scoring systems have been employed for clinical classiﬁcation of neurological deﬁcits following SCI. The ﬁrst classiﬁcation system, “Frankel Grade,” was developed by Frankel and colleagues in  (). They assessed the severity and prognosis of SCI using numerical sensory and motor scales (). This was a -grade system in which Grade A was the most severe SCI with complete loss of sensory and motor function below the level of injury. Grade B represented complete motor loss with preserved sensory function and sacral sparing. Patients in Grade C and D had diﬀerent degrees of motor function preservation and Grade E represented normal sensory and motor function. The “Frankel Grade” was widely utilized after its publication due to its ease of use. However, lack of clear distinction between Grades C and D and inaccurate categorization of motor improvements in patients over time, led to its replacement by other scoring systems (). Other classiﬁcation methods followed Frankel’s system. In , Bracken et al. at Yale University School of Medicine classiﬁed motor and sensory functions separately in a  and scale systems, respectively (). However, this scoring system failed to account for sacral function (). Moreover, integration of motor and sensory classiﬁcations was impossible in this system and it was abandoned due to complexity and impracticality in clinical settings (). Several other scoring systems were developed in ’ and ’s by diﬀerent groups such as Lucas and Ducker at the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services in late ’s (), Klose and colleagues at the University of Miami Neuro-spinal Index (UMNI) in early s () and Chehrazi and colleagues (Yale Scale) in  (). These scoring systems also became obsolete due to their disadvantage in evaluation of sacral functions, diﬃculty of use or discrepancies between their motor and sensory scoring sub-systems ().

Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury FIGURE  | ASIA scoring for the neurological classiﬁcation of the SCI. A sample scoring sheet used for ASIA scoring in clinical setting is provided (adopted from: American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scoring System The ASIA scoring system is currently the most widely accepted and employed clinical scoring system for SCI. ASIA was developed in  by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association and has been updated over time to improve its reliability (Figure ). In this system, sensory function is scored from – and motor function from  to  (). The ASIA impairment score (AIS) ranges from complete loss of sensation and movement (AIS = A) to normal neurological function (AIS = E). The ﬁrst step in ASIA system is to identify the neurological level of injury (NLI). In this assessment, except upper cervical vertebrae that closely overlay the underlying spinal cord segments, the anatomical relationship between the spinal cord segments and their corresponding vertebra is not reciprocally aligned along the adult spinal cord (). At thoracic and lumbar levels, each vertebra overlays a spinal cord segment one or two levels below and as the result, a T vertebral burst fracture results in neurological deﬁcit at and below L spinal cord segment. Hence, the neurological level of injury (NLI) is deﬁned as “the most caudal neurological level at which all sensory and motor functions are normal” (). Upon identifying the NLI, if the injury is complete (AIS = A), “zone of partial preservation” (ZPP) is determined (). ZPP is deﬁned as all the segments below the NLI that have some preserved sensory or motor function. A precise record of ZPP enables the examiners to distinguish spontaneous from treatment-induced functional recovery, thus, essential for evaluating the therapeutic eﬃcacy of treatments (). Complete loss of motor and preservation of some sensory functions below the neurological level of the injury is categorized as AIS B (). If motor function is also partially spared below the level of the injury, AIS score can be C or D (). The AIS is scored D when the majority of the muscle groups below the level of the injury exhibit strength level of
 or higher (for more details see Figure ). ASIA classiﬁcation combines the assessments of motor, sensory and sacral functions, thus addressing the shortcomings of previous scoring systems (). The validity and reproducibility of ASIA system combined Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury with its accuracy in prediction of patients’ outcome have made it the most accepted and reliable clinical scoring system utilized for neurological classiﬁcation of SCI (). Neurological Outcomes of Spinal Cord Injury In clinical management of SCI, neurological outcomes are generally determined at  h after injury using ASIA scoring system (, ). This time-point has shown to provide a more precise assessment of neurological impairments after SCI (). One important predictor of functional recovery is to determine whether the injury was incomplete or complete. As time passes, SCI patients experience some spontaneous recovery of motor and sensory functions. Most of the functional recovery occurs during the ﬁrst  months and in most cases reaches a plateau by  months after injury (). However, additional recovery may occur up to – months post-injury (). Long term outcomes of SCI are closely related to the level of the injury, the severity of the primary injury and progression of secondary injury, which will be discussed in this review. Depending on the level of SCI, patients experience paraplegia or tetraplegia. Paraplegia is deﬁned as the impairment of sensory or motor function in lower extremities (, ). Patients with incomplete paraplegia generally have a good prognosis in regaining locomotor ability (∼% of patients) within a year (). Complete paraplegic patients, however, experience limited recovery of lower limb function if their NLI is above T (). An NLI below T is associated with % chance of regaining some lower extremity function (). In patients with complete paraplegia, the chance of recovery to an incomplete status is only % with only half of these patients regaining bladder and bowel control (). Tetraplegia is deﬁned as partial or total loss of sensory or motor function in all four limbs. Patients with incomplete tetraplegia will gain better recovery than complete tetraand paraplegia (). Unlike complete SCI, recovery from incomplete tetraplegia usually happens at multiple levels below the NLI (). Patients generally reach a plateau of recovery within – months after injury (). Regaining some motor function within the ﬁrst month after the injury is associated with a better neurological outcome (). Moreover, appearance of muscle ﬂicker (a series of local involuntary muscle contractions) in the lower extremities is highly associated with recovery of function (). Patients with complete tetraplegia, often (–%) regain function at one level below the injury (, ). Importantly, initial muscle strength is an important predictor of functional recovery in these patients (). Complete tetraplegic patients with cervical SCI can regain antigravity muscle function in % of the cases when their initial muscle strength is  on a -point scale (). However, the rate of regaining antigravity muscle strength at one caudal level below the injury increases to % when the patients have initial muscle strength of – on a -point scale (). An association between sensory and motor recovery has been demonstrated in SCI where spontaneous sensory recovery usually follows the pattern of motor recovery (, ). Maintenance of pinprick sensation at the zone of partial preservation or in sacral segments has been shown as a reliable predictor of motor recovery (). One proposed reason for this association is that pinprick ﬁbers in lateral spinothalamic tract travel in proximity of motor ﬁbers in the lateral corticospinal tract, and thus, preservation of sensory ﬁbers can be an indicator of the integrity of motor ﬁber (). Diagnosis of an incomplete injury is of great importance and failure to detect sensory preservation at sacral segments results in an inaccurate assessment of prognosis (). EXPERIMENTAL MODELS OF SPINAL CORD INJURY An Overview of Available Animal Models In the past few decades, various animal models have been developed to allow understanding the complex biomedical mechanisms of SCI and to develop therapeutic strategies for this condition. An ideal animal model should have several characteristics including its relevance to the pathophysiology of human SCI, reproducibility, availability, and its potential to generate various severities of injury (). Small rodents are the most frequently employed animals in SCI studies due to their availability, ease of use and costeﬀectiveness compared to primates and larger non-primate models of SCI (, ). Among rodents, rats more closely mimic pathophysiological, electrophysiological, functional, and morphological features of non-primate and human SCI (). In rat (), cat (), monkey (), and human SCI (), a cystic cavity forms in the center of the spinal cord, which is a surrounded by a rim of anatomically preserved white matter. A study by Metz and colleagues compared the functional and anatomical outcomes of rat contusive injuries and human chronic SCI (). High resolution MRI assessments identiﬁed that SCI-induced neuroanatomical changes such as spinal cord atrophy and size of the lesion were signiﬁcantly correlated with the electrophysiological and functional outcomes in both rat and human contusive injuries (). Histological assessments in rats also showed a close correlation between the spared white matter and functional preservation following injury (). These studies provide evidence that rat models of contusive SCI could serve as an adequate model to develop and evaluate the structural and functional beneﬁts of therapeutic strategies for SCI (). Mice show diﬀerent histopathology than human SCI in which the lesion site is ﬁlled with dense ﬁbrous connective-like tissue (–). Mouse SCI studies show the presence of ﬁbroblast-like cells expressing ﬁbronectin, collagen, CDb, CD, CD, and CD within the lesion core of chronic SCI, while it is absent in the injured spinal cord of rats (). Another key diﬀerence between rat and mice SCI is the time-point of inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration. While microglia/macrophage inﬁltration is relatively consistent between rat and mouse models of SCI (), there is a temporal diﬀerence in inﬁltration of neutrophils and T cells between the two species (, ). In SCI rats, inﬁltration of neutrophils, the ﬁrst responders, peaks at  h post injury, followed by a signiﬁcant decline at – h after SCI (). Similarly, in mouse SCI, neutrophil inﬁltration occurs within  h following injury; however, their numbers continue to rise and do not peak Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury until – days post injury (). T cell inﬁltration also varies between rat and mouse SCI models (). In rats, T cell inﬁltration occurs between  and  days post injury and declines by % in the following  weeks (), whereas in mice, T cell inﬁltration is not detected until  days post injury and their number doubles between  and  weeks post injury (). Regardless of their pathophysiological relevance, mice have been used extensively in SCI studies primarily due to the availability of transgenic and mutant mouse models that have allowed uncovering molecular and cellular mechanisms of SCI (). In recent years, there has been emerging interest in employment of non-human primates and other larger animals such as pig, dog and cat as intermediate pre-clinical models (–) to allow more eﬀective translation of promising treatments from rodent models to human clinical trials (). Although rodents have served as invaluable models for studying SCI mechanisms and therapeutic development, larger mammals, in particular non-human primates, share a closer size, neuroanatomy, and physiology to humans. Importantly, their larger size provides a more relevant platform for drug development, bioengineering inventions, and electrophysiological and rehabilitation studies. Nonetheless, both small and large animal models of SCI have limitations in their ability to predict the outcome in human SCI. One important factor is high degree of variability in the nature of SCI incidence, severity and location of the injury in human SCI, while in laboratory animal models, these variabilities are less (). Values acquired by clinical scoring systems such as ASIA or Frankel scoring systems lack the consistency of the data acquired from laboratory settings, which makes the translation of therapeutic interventions from experimental to clinical settings challenging (). A signiﬁcant eﬀect from an experimental treatment in consistent laboratory settings may not be reproducible in clinical settings due to high variability and heterogeneity in human populations and their injuries (). To date, several pharmacological and cellular preclinical discoveries have led to human clinical trials based on their eﬃcacy in improving the outcomes of SCI in small animal models. However, the majority of these trials failed to reproduce the same eﬃcacy in human SCI. Thus, in pre-clinical studies, animal models, and study designs should be carefully chosen to reﬂect the reality of clinical setting as closely as possible (). Larger animals provide the opportunity to reﬁne promising therapeutic strategies prior to testing in human SCI; however, their higher cost, need for specialized facilities and small subject (sample) size have limited their use in SCI research (). Thus, rodents are currently the most commonly employed models for preclinical discoveries and therapeutic development, while the use of larger animals is normally pursued for late stage therapies that have shown eﬃcacy and promise in small animal models. Table  provides a summary of available SCI models. An Overview of Experimental Models of Spinal Cord Injury Animal models are also classiﬁed based on the type of SCI. The following sections will provide an overview on the available SCI models that are developed based on injury mechanisms, their speciﬁcations and relevance to human SCI (Table ). Transection Models A complete transection model of SCI is relatively easy to reproduce (). However, this model is less relevant to human SCI as a complete transection of the spinal cord rarely happens (). While they do not represent clinical reality of SCI, transection models are speciﬁcally suitable for studying axonal regeneration or developing biomaterial scaﬀolds to bridge the gap between proximal and distal stamps of the severed spinal cord (). Due to complete disconnection from higher motor centers, this model is also suitable for studying the role of propriospinal motor and sensory circuits in recovery of locomotion following SCI (, ). Partial transection models including hemi-section, unilateral transection and dorsal column lesions are other variants of transection models (). Partial transection models are valuable for investigation of nerve grafting, plasticity and where a comparison between injured and non-injured pathways is needed in the same animal (). However, these models lead to a less severe injury and higher magnitude of spontaneous recovery rendering them less suitable for development and evaluation of new therapies (). Contusive Models Contusion is caused by a transient physical impact to the spinal cord and is clinically-relevant. There are currently three types of devices that can produce contusion injury in animal models: weight-drop apparatus, electromagnetic impactor, and a recently introduced air gun device (). The impactor model was ﬁrst introduced by Gruner at New York University (NYU) in 
(). The original NYU impactor included a metal rod of speciﬁc weight ( g) that could be dropped on the exposed spinal cord from a speciﬁc height to induce SCI (). This model allowed induction of a deﬁned severity of SCI by adjusting the height, which the rod fell on the spinal cord (). Parameters such as time, velocity at impact and biomechanical response of the tissue can be recorded for analysis and veriﬁcation (). The NYU impactor was later renamed to Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study (MASCIS) impactor, and conditions surrounding the study and use of the MASCIS impactor were standardized (). Since its introduction, the MASCIS impactor has been updated twice. The most recent version, MACIS III, was introduced in  and included both electromagnetic control and digital recording of the impact parameters (). However, inability to control duration of impact and “weight bounce,” that could cause multiple impacts, have been known limitations of MASCIS impactors (). The Inﬁnite Horizon (IH) impactor is another type of impactor that utilizes a stepping motor to generate forcecontrolled impact in contrast to free fall in the MASICS impactor (). This feature allows for better control over the force of impact and prevents “weight bounce” as the computercontrolled metal impounder can be immediately retracted upon transmitting a desired force to the spinal cord (). IH impactor can be set to diﬀerent force levels to provide mild, moderate and severe SCI in rats (ex. , , and  kdyn) ().

Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury with IH impactors is unreliability of their clamps in holding the spinal column ﬁrmly during the impact that can cause inconsistent parenchymal injury and neurological deﬁcits (). Ohio State University (OSU) impactor is a computer controlled electromagnetic impactor that was originally invented in  and reﬁned in  to improve reliability (). As the OSU impactor is electromagnetically controlled, multiple strikes are avoided (). Subsequently, a modiﬁed version of the OSU impactor was developed in  for use in mice (). However, the OSU impactor is limited by its inability to determine the precise initial contact point with the spinal cord due to displacement of CSF upon loading the device (). To date, MASCIS, IH and OSU impactor devices have been employed extensively and successfully to induce SCI. These impactor devices are available for small and large animals such as mice, rats, marmosets, cats, and pigs (, ). Compressive Models Compressive models of SCI have been also employed for several decades (). While contusion injury is achieved by applying a force for a very brief period (milliseconds), the compression injury consists of an initial contusion for milliseconds followed by a prolonged compression through force application for a longer duration (seconds to minutes) (). Thus, compression injury can be categorized as contusive-compressive models (). Various models of compressive SCI are available. Clip compression is the most commonly used compression model of SCI in rat and mice (, , , ). It was ﬁrst introduced by Rivlin and Tator in  (). In this model, following laminectomy, a modiﬁed aneurism clip with a calibrated closing force is applied to the spinal cord for a speciﬁc duration of time (usually  min) to induce a contusivecompressive injury (). The severity of injury can be calibrated and modiﬁed by adjusting the force of the clip and the duration of compression (). For example, applying a  g clip for  min typically produces a severe SCI, while a  g clip creates a moderate to severe injury with the same duration (). Aneurysm clips were originally designed for use in rat SCI, however, in recent years smaller and larger clips have been developed to accommodate its use in mice () and pig models (). The clip compression model has several advantages compared to contusion models. This method is less expensive and easier to perform (). Importantly, in contrast to the impactor injury that contusion is only applied dorsally to the spinal cord, the clip compression model provides contusion and compression simultaneously both dorsally and ventrally. Hence, clip compression model more closely mimics the most common form of human SCI, which is primarily caused by dislocation and burst compression fractures (). Despite its advantages, clip compression model can create variabilities such as the velocity of closing and actual delivered force that cannot be measured precisely at the time of application (). Calibrated forceps compression has been also employed to induce SCI in rodents. This simple and inexpensive compressive model was ﬁrst utilized in  for induction of SCI in guinea pigs (). In this method, a calibrated forceps with a spacer is used to compress the spinal cord bilaterally (). This model lacks the initial impact and contusive injury, which is associated with most cases of human traumatic SCI. Accordingly, this model is not a clinically relevant model for reproducing human SCI pathology and therapeutic development (). Balloon Compression model has been also utilized extensively in primates and larger animals such as dogs and cats (–). In this model, a catheter with an inﬂatable balloon is inserted in the epidural or subdural space. The inﬂation of the balloon with air or saline for a speciﬁc duration of time provides the force for induction of SCI (). Generally, all compression models (clip, forceps, and balloon) have the same limitation as the velocity and amount of force are unmeasurable (). In conclusion, while existing animal models do not recapitulate all clinical aspects of human SCI, the compression and contusion models are considered to be the most relevant and commonly employed methods for understanding the secondary injury mechanisms and therapeutic development for SCI. Overview of Secondary Mechanisms of Spinal Cord Injury Secondary injury begins within minutes following the initial primary injury and continues for weeks or months causing progressive damage of spinal cord tissue surrounding the lesion site (). The concept of secondary SCI was ﬁrst introduced by Allen in  (). While studying SCI in dogs, he observed that removal of the post traumatic hematomyelia improved neurological outcome. He hypothesized that presence of some “biochemical factors” in the necrotic hemorrhagic lesion causes further damage to the spinal cord (). The term of secondary injury is still being used in the ﬁeld and is referred to a series of cellular, molecular and biochemical phenomena that continue to self-destruct spinal cord tissue and impede neurological recovery following SCI (Figure ) (). Secondary injury can be temporally divided into acute, sub-acute, and chronic phases. The acute phase begins immediately following SCI and includes vascular damage, ionic imbalance, neurotransmitter accumulation (excitotoxicity), free radical formation, calcium inﬂux, lipid peroxidation, inﬂammation, edema, and necrotic cell death (, , ). As the injury progresses, the sub-acute phase of injury begins which involves apoptosis, demyelination of surviving axons, Wallerian degeneration, axonal dieback, matrix remodeling, and evolution of a glial scar around the injury site (Figure ). Further changes occur in the chronic phase of injury including the formation of a cystic cavity, progressive axonal die-back, and maturation of the glial scar (, –). Here, we will review the key components of acute secondary injury that contribute to the pathophysiology of SCI (Figures , ). Vascular Injury, Ischemia and Hypoxia Disruption of spinal cord vascular supply and hypo-perfusion is one of the early consequences of primary injury (). Hypovolemia and hemodynamic shock in SCI patients due to excessive bleeding and neurogenic shock result in compromised spinal cord perfusion and ischemia (). Larger vessels such as anterior spinal artery usually remain intact (, ), while rupture of smaller intramedullary vessels and capillaries that Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury FIGURE  | Summary of secondary injury processes following traumatic spinal cord injury. Diagram shows the key pathophysiological events that occur after primary injury and lead to progressive tissue degeneration. Vascular disruption and ischemia occur immediately after primary injury that initiate glial activation, neuroinﬂammation, and oxidative stress. These acute changes results in cell death, axonal injury, matrix remodeling, and formation of a glial scar. are susceptible to traumatic damage leads to extravasation of leukocytes and red blood cells (). Increased tissue pressure in edematous injured spinal cord and hemorrhage-induced vasospasm in intact vessels further disrupts blood ﬂow to the spinal cord (, ). In rat and monkey models of SCI, there is a progressive reduction in blood ﬂow at the lesion epicenter within the ﬁrst few hours after injury which remains low for up to  h (). The gray matter is more prone to ischemic damage compared to the white matter as it has a -fold higher density of capillary beds and contains neurons with high metabolic demand (, , ). After injury, white matter blood ﬂow typically returns to normal levels within  min post injury, whereas there are multiple hemorrhages in the gray matter and as a result, re-perfusion usually does not occur for the ﬁrst
 h (, , ). Vascular insult, hemorrhage and ischemia ultimately lead to cell death and tissue destruction through multiple mechanisms, including oxygen deprivation, loss of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), excitotoxicity, ionic imbalance, free radical formation, and necrotic cell death. Cellular necrosis and release of cytoplasmic content increase the extracellular level of glutamate causing glutamate excitotoxicity (, ). Moreover, re-establishment of blood ﬂow in ischemic tissue leads to further damage through generating free radicals and eliciting an inﬂammatory response (, ) that will be discussed in this review. Ionic Imbalance, Excitotoxicity and Oxidative Damage Within few minutes after primary SCI, the combination of direct cellular damage and ischemia/hypoxia triggers a signiﬁcant rise of extracellular glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS (). Glutamate binds to ionotropic (NMDA, AMPA, and Kainate receptors) as well as metabotropic receptors resulting in calcium inﬂux inside the cells (–) (). The eﬀect of glutamate is not restricted to neurons as its receptors are vastly expressed on the surface of all glia and endothelial cells (–). Astrocytes can also release excess glutamate extracellularly upon elevation of their intracellular Ca+ levels. Reduced ability of activated astrocytes for glutamate re-uptake from the interstitial space due to lipid peroxidation results in further accumulation of glutamate in the SCI milieu (). Using microdialysis, elevated levels of glutamate have been detected in the white matter in the acute stage of injury (). Based on a study by Panter and colleagues, glutamate increase is detected during the ﬁrst – min post SCI and returns to the basal levels after  min (). Under normal condition, concentration of free Ca+ can considerably vary in diﬀerent parts of the cell (). In the cytosol, Ca+ ranges from – nM while it approaches .– . mM in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (–). A long-lasting abnormal increase in Ca+ concentration in cytosol, mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum has detrimental consequences for the cell (–). Mitochondria play a central role in calcium dependent neuronal death (). In neurons, during glutamate induced excitotoxicity, NMDA receptor overactivity leads to mitochondrial calcium overload, which can cause apoptotic or necrotic cell death (). Shortly after SCI, Ca+ enters mitochondria through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (). While the amount of mitochondrial calcium is limited during the resting state of a neuron, they can store a high amount of Ca+ following stimulation (). Calcium overload also activates a host of protein kinases and phospholipases that results in calpain mediated protein degradation and oxidative damage due to mitochondrial failure (). In the injured white matter, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and myelin are also damaged by the increased release of glutamate and Ca+-dependent excitotoxicity (). Within the ﬁrst few hours after injury, oligodendrocytes show signs Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury FIGURE  | Pathophysiology of traumatic spinal cord injury. This schematic diagram illustrates the composition of normal and injured spinal cord. Of note, while these events are shown in one ﬁgure, some of the pathophysiological events may not temporally overlap and can occur at various phases of SCI, which are described here. Immediately after primary injury, activation of resident astrocytes and microglia and subsequent inﬁltration of blood-borne immune cells results in a robust neuroinﬂammatory response. This acute neuroinﬂammatory response plays a key role in orchestrating the secondary injury mechanisms in the sub-acute and chronic phases that lead to cell death and tissue degeneration, as well as formation of the glial scar, axonal degeneration and demyelination. During the acute phase, monocyte-derived macrophages occupy the epicenter of the injury to scavenge tissue debris. T and B lymphocytes also inﬁltrate the spinal cord during sub-acute phase and produce pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines, autoantibodies reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that contribute to tissue degeneration. On the other hand, M-like macrophages and regulatory T and B cells produce growth factors and pro-regenerative cytokines such as ILthat foster tissue repair and wound healing. Loss of oligodendrocytes in acute and sub-acute stages of SCI leads to axonal demyelination followed by spontaneous remyelination in sub-acute and chronic phases. During the acute and sub-acute phases of SCI; astrocytes, OPCs and pericytes, which normally reside in the spinal cord parenchyma, proliferate and migrate to the site of injury and contribute to the formation of the glial scar. The glial scar and its associated matrix surround the injury epicenter and create a cellular and biochemical zone with both beneﬁcial and detrimental roles in the repair process. Acutely, the astrocytic glial scar limits the spread of neuroinﬂammation from the lesion site to the healthy tissue. However, establishment of a mature longstanding glial scar and upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are shown to inhibit axonal regeneration/sprouting and cell differentiation in subacute and chronic phases. of caspaseactivation and other apoptotic features, and their density declines (). Interestingly, while glutamate excitotoxicity is triggered by ionic imbalance in the white matter, in the gray matter, it is largely associated with the activity of neuronal NMDA receptors (, ). Altogether, activation of NMDA receptors and consequent Ca+ overload Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury appears to induce intrinsic apoptotic pathways in neurons and oligodendrocytes and causes cell death in the ﬁrst week of SCI in the rat (, ). Administration of NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-) shortly following SCI has been associated with improved functional recovery and reduced edema (). Mitochondrial calcium overload also impedes mitochondrial respiration and results in ATP depletion disabling Na+/K+ ATPase and increasing intracellular Na+ (, –). This reverses the function of the Na+ dependent glutamate transporter that normally utilizes Na+ gradient to transfer glutamate into the cells (, , ). Moreover, the excess intracellular Na+ reverses the activity of Na+/Ca+ exchanger allowing more Ca+ inﬂux (). Cellular depolarization activates voltage gated Na+ channels that results in entry of Cl− and water into the cells along with Na+ causing swelling and edema (). Increased Na+ concentration over-activates Na+/H+ exchanger causing a rise in intracellular H+ (, ). Resultant intracellular acidosis increases membrane permeability to Ca+ that exacerbates the injury-induced ionic imbalance (, ). Axons are more susceptible to the damage caused by ionic imbalance due to their high concentration of voltage gated Na+ channels in the nodes of Ranvier (). Accumulating evidence shows that administration of Na+ channel blockers such as Riluzole attenuates tissue damage and improves functional recovery in SCI underlining sodium as a key player in secondary injury mechanisms (–). SCI results in production of free radicals and nitric oxide (NO) (). Mitochondrial Ca+ overload activates NADPH oxidase (NOX) and induces generation of superoxide by electron transport chain (ETC) (). Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) produced by the activity of NOX and ETC activates cytosolic poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP consumes and depletes NAD+ causing failure of glycolysis, ATP depletion and cell death (). Moreover, PAR polymers produced by PARP activity, induce the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and induce cell death (). On the other hand, acidosis caused by SCI results in the release of intracellular iron from ferritin and transferrin (). Spontaneous oxidation of Fe+ to Fe+ gives rise to more superoxide radicals (). Subsequently, the Fenton reaction between Fe+ and hydrogen peroxide produces highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (). The resultant ROS and RNS react with numerous targets including lipids in the cell membrane with the most deleterious eﬀects (, ). Because free radicals are short-lived and diﬃcult to assess, measurements of their activity and ﬁnal products, such as Malondialdehyde (MDA), are more reliable following SCI. Current evidence indicates that MDA levels are elevated as early as  h and up to  week after SCI (, ). Oxidation of lipids and proteins is one of the key mechanisms of secondary injury following SCI (). Lipid peroxidation starts when ROSs interact with polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane and generate reactive lipids that will then form lipid peroxyl radicals upon interacting with free superoxide radicals (, ). Each lipid peroxyl radical can react with a neighboring fatty acid, turn it into an active lipid and start a chain reaction that continues until no more unsaturated lipids are available or terminates when the reactive lipid quenches with another radical (). The ﬁnal products of this “termination” step of the lipid peroxidation is -hydroxynonenal (HNE) and -propenal, which are highly toxic to the cells (–). Lipid peroxidation is also an underlying cause of ionic imbalance through destabilizing cellular membranes such as cytoplasmic membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (). Moreover, lipid peroxidation leads to Na+/K+ ATPase dysfunction that exacerbates the intracellular Na+ overload (). In addition to ROS associated lipid peroxidation, amino acids are subject to signiﬁcant RNS associated oxidative damage following SCI (). RNSs (containing ONOO−) can nitrate the tyrosine residues of amino acids to form -nitrotyrosine (NT), a marker for peroxynitrite (ONOO−) mediated protein damage (). Lipid and protein oxidation following SCI has a number of detrimental consequences at cellular level including mitochondrial respiratory and metabolic failure as well as DNA alteration that ultimately lead to cell death (). Cell Death in Spinal Cord Injury Cell death is a major event in the secondary injury mechanisms that aﬀects neurons and glia after SCI (–). Cell death can happen through various mechanisms in response to various injury-induced mediators. Necrosis and apoptosis were originally identiﬁed as two major cell death mechanisms following SCI (–). However, recent research has uncovered additional forms of cell death. In , the “Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death” (NCCD) NCCD deﬁned  diﬀerent forms of cell death such as necroptosis, pyroptosis, and netosis (). Among the identiﬁed modes of cell death, to date, necrosis, necroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy have been studied more extensively in the context of SCI and will be discussed in this review. Following SCI, neurons and glial cells die through necrosis as the result of mechanical damage at the time of primary injury that also continues to the acute and subacute stages of injury (, ). Necrosis occurs due to a multitude of factors including accumulation of toxic blood components (), glutamate excitotoxicity and ionic imbalance (), ATP depletion (), pro-inﬂammatory cytokine release by neutrophils and lymphocytes (, ), and free radical formation (, –). It was originally thought that necrosis is caused by a severe impact on a cell that results in rapid cell swelling and lysis. However, follow up evidence showed that in the case of seizure, ischemia and hypoglycemia, necrotic neurons show signs of shrunken, pyknotic, and condensed nuclei, with swollen, irreversibly damaged mitochondria and plasma membrane that are surrounded by astrocytic processes (). Moreover, necrosis was conventionally viewed as instantaneous energy-independent non-programmed cell death (, ). However, recent research has identiﬁed another form of necrosis, termed as necroptosis, that is executed by regulated mechanisms. Programmed necrosis or “necroptosis” has been described more recently as a highly regulated, caspase-independent cell death with similar morphological characteristics as necrosis (). Necroptosis is a receptor-mediated process. It is induced downstream of the TNF receptor  (TNFR) and is dependent on the activity of the receptor interacting protein kinase  (RIPK) Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury and RIPK. Recent studies has uncovered a key role for RIPK as the mediator of necroptosis and a regulator of the innate immune response involved in both inﬂammation and cell death (). Evidence from SCI studies show that lysosomal damage can potentiate necroptosis by promoting RIPK and RIPK accumulation (). Interestingly, inhibition of necroptosis by necrostatin-, a RIPK inhibitor, improves functional outcomes after SCI (). These initial ﬁndings suggest that modulation of necroptosis pathways seems to be a promising target for neuroprotective strategies after SCI. Apoptosis is the most studied mechanism of cell death after SCI. Apoptosis represents a programmed, energy dependent mode of cell death that begins within hours of primary injury (). This process takes place in cells that survive the primary injury but endure enough insult to activate their apoptotic pathways (). In apoptosis, the cell shrinks and is eventually phagocytosed without induction of an inﬂammatory response (). Apoptosis typically occurs in a delayed manner in areas more distant to the injury site and most abundantly aﬀects oligodendrocytes. In rat SCI, apoptosis happens as early as  h after the injury and reaches a peak at  day (). At the site of injury majority of oligodendrocytes are lost within  days after SCI (). However, apoptosis can be observed at a diminished rate for weeks after SCI (, ). Microglia and astrocytes also undergo apoptosis (, ). Interestingly, apoptotic cell death occurs in the chronically injured spinal cord in rat, monkey and human models of SCI, which is thought to be due to loss of trophic support from degenerating axons (, ). Apoptosis is induced through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways based on the triggering mechanism (). The extrinsic pathway is triggered by activation of death receptors such as FAS and TNFR, which eventually activates caspase  (). The intrinsic pathway, however, is regulated through a balance between intracellular proand anti-apoptotic proteins and is triggered by the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and activating caspase  (). In SCI lesion, apoptosis primarily happens due to injury induced Ca+ inﬂux, which activates caspases and calpain; enzymes involved in breakdown of cellular proteins (). Moreover, it is believed that the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in remote areas from the lesion epicenter can be mediated through cytokines such as TNF-α, free radical damage and excitotoxicity since calcium from damaged cells within the lesion barely reaches these remote areas (, ). Fas mediated cell death has been suggested as a key mechanism of apoptosis following SCI (, –). Post-mortem studies on acute and chronic human SCI and animal models revealed that Fas mediated apoptosis plays a role in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and inﬂammatory response at acute and subacute stages of SCI (). Fas deﬁcient mice exhibit a signiﬁcant reduction in apoptosis and inﬂammatory response evidenced by reduced macrophage inﬁltration and inﬂammatory cytokine expression following SCI (). Interestingly, Fas deﬁcient mice show a signiﬁcantly improved functional recovery after SCI () suggesting the promise of anti-apoptotic strategies for SCI. SCI also results in a dysregulated autophagy (). Normally, autophagy plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of cells by aiding in the turnover of proteins and organelles. In autophagy, cells degrade harmful, defective or unnecessary cytoplasmic proteins and organelles through a lysosomal dependent mechanism (, ). The process of autophagy starts with the formation of an autophagosome around the proteins and organelles that are tagged for autophagy (). Next, fusion of the phagosome with a lysosome form an autolysosome that begins a recycling process (). In response to cell injury and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy is activated and limits cellular loss (, ). Current evidence suggests a neuroprotective role for autophagy after SCI (, ). Dysregulation of autophagy contributes to neuronal loss (, ). Accumulation of autophagosomes in ventral horn motor neurons have been detected acutely following SCI (). Neurons with dysregulated autophagy exhibit higher expression of caspase  and become more prone to apoptosis (). Moreover, blocking autophagy has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (–). Autophagy promotes cell survival through elimination of toxic proteins and damaged mitochondria (, ). Interestingly, autophagy is crucial in cytoskeletal remodeling and stabilizes neuronal microtubules by degrading SCG, a protein involved in microtubule disassembly (). Pharmacological induction of autophagy in a hemi-section model of SCI in mice has been associated with improved neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration, following SCI (). Altogether, although further studies are needed, autophagy is currently viewed as a beneﬁcial mechanism in SCI. Adaptive and Innate Immune Response in Spinal Cord Injury Neuroinﬂammation is a key component of the secondary injury mechanisms with local and systemic consequences. Inﬂammation was originally thought to be detrimental for the outcome of SCI (). However, now it is well-recognized that inﬂammation can be both beneﬁcial and detrimental following SCI, depending on the time point and activation state of immune cells (). There are multiple cell types involved in the inﬂammatory response following injury including neutrophils, resident microglia, and astrocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), bloodborn macrophages, Band T-lymphocytes () (Figure ). The ﬁrst phase of inﬂammation (– days post injury) involves the recruitment of resident microglia and astrocytes and bloodborn neutrophils to the injury site (). The second phase of inﬂammation begins approximately  days post injury and involves the recruitment of blood-born macrophages, Band Tlymphocytes to the injury site (, –). T lymphocytes become activated in response to antigen presentation by macrophages, microglia and other antigen presenting cells (APCs) (). CD+ helper T cells produce cytokines that stimulate B cell antibody production and activate phagocytes () (Figure ). In SCI, B cells produce autoantibodies against injured spinal cord tissue, which exacerbate neuroinﬂammation and cause tissue destruction (). While inﬂammation is more pronounced in the acute phase of injury, it continues in subacute and chronic phase and may persist for the remainder of a patients’ life (). Interestingly, composition and phenotype of Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury FIGURE  | Immune response in spinal cord injury. Under normal circumstances, there is a balance between pro-inﬂammatory effects of CD+ effector T cells (Teff) and anti-inﬂammatory effects of regulatory T and B cells (Treg and Breg). Treg and Breg suppress the activation of antigen speciﬁc CD+ Teff cells through production of ILand TGF-β. Injury disrupts this balance and promote a pro-inﬂammatory environment. Activated microglia/macrophages release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines and present antigens to CD+ T cells causing activation of antigen speciﬁc effector T cells. Teff cells stimulate antigen speciﬁc B cells to undergo clonal expansion and produce autoantibodies against spinal cord tissue antigens. These autoantibodies cause neurodegeneration through FcR mediated phagocytosis or complement mediated cytotoxicity. M macrophages/microglia release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are detrimental to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Breg cells possess the ability to promote Treg development and restrict Teff cell differentiation. Breg cells could also induce apoptosis in Teff cells through Fas mediate mechanisms. inﬂammatory cells change based on the injury phase and the signals present in the injury microenvironment. It is established that microglia/macrophages, T cells, B cells are capable of adopting a pro-inﬂammatory or an anti-inﬂammatory proregenerative phenotype in the injured spinal cord (, –). The role of each immune cell population in the pathophysiology of SCI will be discussed in detail in upcoming sections. Astrocytes Astrocytes are not considered an immune cell per se; however, they play pivotal roles in the neuroinﬂammatory processes in CNS injury and disease. Their histo-anatomical localization in the CNS has placed them in a strategic position for participating in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the CNS (). In normal CNS, astrocytes play major roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis. They contribute to the structure and function of blood-brain-barrier (BBB), provide nutrients and growth factors to neurons (), and remove excess ﬂuid, ions, and neurotransmitters such as glutamate from synaptic spaces and extracellular microenvironment (). Astrocytes also play key roles in the pathologic CNS by regulating BBB permeability and reconstruction as well as immune cell activity and traﬃcking (). Astrocytes contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses following SCI by diﬀerential activation of their intracellular signaling pathways in response to environmental signals (). Astrocytes react acutely to CNS injury by increasing cytokine and chemokine production (). They mediate chemokine production and recruitment of neutrophils through an ILR-Myd pathway (). Activation of the nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) pathway, one of the key downstream targets of interleukin (IL)R-Myd axis, increases expression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), which are necessary for adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes in inﬂammatory conditions such as SCI (, ). Within minutes of injury, production of IL-β is signiﬁcantly elevated in astrocytes and microglia (). Moreover, chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-, chemokine C-C motif ligand  (CCL), CX-C motif ligand  (CXCL), and CXCL are produced by astrocytes, and enhance the recruitment of neutrophils and pro-inﬂammatory macrophages following injury (, ). Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Astrocytes also promote pro-inﬂammatory M-like phenotype in microglia/macrophages in the injured spinal cord through their production of TNF-α, IL-, and IFN-γ (–). Interestingly, astrocytes also produce anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-, which can promote a pro-regenerative M-like phenotype in microglia/macrophages (, , ). Immunomodulatory role of astrocytes is deﬁned by activity of various signaling pathways through a wide variety of surface receptors (). For example, gp, a member of IL-
 cytokine family, activates SHP/Ras/Erk signaling cascade in astrocytes and limits neuroinﬂammation in autoimmune rodent models (). TGF-β signaling in astrocytes has been implicated in modulation of neuroinﬂammation through inhibition of NF-κB activity and nuclear translocation (, ). STAT is another key signaling pathway in astrocytes with beneﬁcial properties in neuroinﬂammation. Increase in STAT phosphorylation enhances astrocytic scar formation and restricts the expansion of inﬂammatory cells in mouse SCI, which is associated with improved functional recovery (). Detrimental signaling pathways in astrocytes are known to be activated by cytokines, sphingolipids and neurotrophins (). As an example, ILis a key pro-inﬂammatory cytokine produced by eﬀector T cells that can bind to IL-R on the astrocyte surface (). Activation of IL-R results in the activation of NF-κB, which enhances expression of pro-inﬂammatory mediators, activation of oxidative pathways and exacerbation of neuroinﬂammation (, ). This evidence shows the signiﬁcance of astrocytes in the inﬂammatory processes following SCI and other neuroinﬂammatory diseases of the CNS. Neutrophils Neutrophils inﬁltrate the spinal cord from the bloodstream within the ﬁrst few hours after injury (). Their population increases acutely in the injured spinal cord tissue and reaches a peak within  h post-injury (). The presence of neutrophils is mostly limited to the acute phase of SCI as they are rarely found sub-acutely in the injured spinal cord (). The role of neutrophils in SCI pathophysiology is controversial. Evidence shows that neutrophils contribute to phagocytosis and clearance of tissue debris (). They release inﬂammatory cytokines, proteases and free radicals that degrade ECM, activate astrocytes and microglia and initiate neuroinﬂammation (). Although neutrophils have been conventionally associated with tissue damage (, ), their elimination compromises the healing process and impedes functional recovery (). To elucidate the role of neutrophils in SCI, Stirling and colleagues used a speciﬁc antibody to reduce circulating LyG/Gr+ neutrophils in a mouse model of thoracic contusive SCI (). This approach signiﬁcantly reduced neutrophil inﬁltration in the injured spinal cord by % at  and  h after SCI (). Surprisingly, neutrophil depletion aggravated the neurological and structural outcomes in the injured animals suggesting a beneﬁcial role for neutrophils in the acute phase of injury (). It is shown that simulated neutrophils release ILreceptor antagonist that can exert neuroprotective eﬀects following SCI (). Moreover, ablation of neutrophils results in altered expression of cytokines and chemokines and downregulation of growth factors such as ﬁbroblast growth factors (FGFs), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the injured spinal cord that seemingly disrupt the normal healing process (). Altogether, neutrophils play important roles in regulating neuroinﬂammation at the early stage of SCI that shapes the immune response and repair processes at later stages. While neutrophils were originally viewed as being detrimental in SCI, emerging evidence shows their critical role in the repair process. Further investigations are required to elucidate the role of neutrophils in SCI pathophysiology. Microglia and Macrophages Following neutrophil invasion, microglia/macrophages populate the injured spinal cord within – days post-SCI. Macrophage population is derived from invading blood-borne monocytes or originate from the CNS resident macrophages that reside in the perivascular regions within meninges and subarachnoid space (, ). The population of microglia/macrophages reaches its peak at – days post-injury in mouse SCI, followed by a decline in the subacute and chronic phases (, ). While macrophages and microglia share many functions and immunological markers, they have diﬀerent origins. Microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that originate from yolk sac during the embryonic period (). Macrophages are derived from blood monocytes, which originate from myeloid progeny in the bone marrow (, ). Upon injury, acute disruption of brain-spinal cord barrier (BSB) enables monocytes, to inﬁltrate the spinal cord tissue and transform into macrophages (). Macrophages populate the injury epicenter, while resident microglia are mainly located in the perilesional area (). Once activated, macrophages, and microglia are morphologically and immunohistologically indistinguishable (). Macrophages and microglia play a beneﬁcial role in CNS regeneration. They promote the repair process by expression of growth promoting factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin(NT) and thrombospondin (, ). Macrophages and microglia are important for wound healing process following SCI due to their ability for phagocytosis and scavenging damaged cells and myelin debris following SCI (, ). Based on microenvironmental signals, macrophages/microglia can be polarized to either proinﬂammatory (M-like) or anti-inﬂammatory pro-regenerative (M-like) phenotype, and accordingly contribute to injury or repair processes following SCI (, , –). Whether both microglia and macrophages possess the ability to polarize or it is mainly the property of monocyte derived macrophages is still a matter of debate and needs further elucidation (–). Some evidence show that Proinﬂammatory Mlike microglia/macrophages can be induced by exposure to Th speciﬁc cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ (, ). Moreover, the SCI microenvironment appears to drive M polarization of activated macrophages (). SCI studies have revealed that increased level of the proinﬂammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and intracellular accumulation of iron drives an M-like proinﬂammatory phenotype in macrophages after injury (). Importantly, following SCI, activated M-like Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury microglia/macrophages highly express MHCII and present antigens to T cells and contribute to the activation and regulation of innate and adaptive immune response (Figure ) (, ). Studies on acute and subacute SCI and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models have shown that M-like macrophages are associated with higher expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and increased EAE severity and tissue damage (–). In vitro, addition of activated M-like macrophages to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron cultures leads to axonal retraction and failure of regeneration as the expression of CSPGs is much higher in M-like compared to M-like macrophages (, ). M-like macrophages also produce other repulsive factors such as repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMA) that is shown to induce axonal retraction following SCI (, ). Interestingly, recent evidence shows that IFN-γ and TNFα polarized M microglia show reduced capacity for phagocytosis (), a process that is critical for tissue repair after SCI. Pro-regenerative M-like microglia/macrophages, are polarized by Th cytokines, ILand ILand exhibit a high level of IL-, TGF-β, and arginasewith reduced NF-κB pathway activity (). ILis a potent immunoregulatory cytokine with positive roles in repair and regeneration following CNS injury (–). ILknock-out mice show higher production of pro-inﬂammatory and oxidative stress mediators after SCI (). Lack of ILis also correlated with upregulated levels of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax and reduced expression of anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl(). SCI mice that lacked ILexhibited poorer recovery of function compared to wild-type mice (). Our recent studies show that ILpolarized M microglia show enhanced capacity for phagocytosis (). We have also found that M polarized microglia enhance the ability of neural precursor cells for oligodendrocyte diﬀerentiation through ILmediated mechanisms (). In addition to immune modulation, M-like microglia/macrophages promote axonal regeneration (). However, similar to the detrimental eﬀects of prolonged M macrophage response, excessive M-like activity promotes ﬁbrotic scar formation through the release of factors such as TGF-β, PDGF, VEGF, IGF-, and Galectin(, –). Hence, a balance between proinﬂammatory M and proregenerative M macrophage/microglia response is beneﬁcial for the repair of SCI (). T and B Lymphocytes T and B lymphocytes play pivotal role in the adaptive immune response after SCI (). Lymphocytes inﬁltrate the injured spinal cord acutely during the ﬁrst week of injury and remain chronically in mouse and rat SCI (, , , ). In contrast to the innate immune response that can be activated directly by foreign antigens, the adaptive immune response requires a complex signaling process in T cells elicited by antigen presenting cells (). Similar to other immune cells, T and B lymphocytes adopt diﬀerent phenotypes and contribute to both injury and repair processes in response to microenvironmental signals (, ). SCI elicits a CNS-speciﬁc autoimmune response in T and B cells, which remains active chronically (). Autoreactive T cells can exert direct toxic eﬀects on neurons and glial cells (, ). Moreover, T cells can indirectly aﬀect neural cell function and survival through pro-inﬂammatory cytokine and chemokine production (e.g. IL-β, TNF-α, IL-, CCL, CCL, and CXCL) (, ). Genetic elimination of T cells (in athymic nude rats) or pharmacological inhibition of T cells (using cyclosporine A and tacrolimus) leads to improved tissue preservation and functional recovery after SCI (, ) signifying the impact of T cells in SCI pathophysiology and repair. Under normal circumstances, systemic autoreactive eﬀector CD+ helper T cells (Teﬀ) are suppressed by CD+FoxP+ regulatory T cells (Treg) (Figure ) (, ). This inhibition is regulated through various mechanisms such as release of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines ILand TGF-β by the Treg cells (Figure ) (). Moreover, it is known that Treg mediated inhibition of antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) prevent Teﬀ cell activation (). Following SCI, this Treg -Teﬀ regulation is disrupted. Increased activity of autoreactive Teﬀ cells contributes to tissue damage through production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, promoting M-like macrophage phenotype and induction of Fas mediated neuronal and oligodendroglial apoptosis (Figure ) (). Moreover, autoreactive Teﬀ cells promote activation and diﬀerentiation of antigen speciﬁc B cells to autoantibody producing plasma cells that contribute to tissue damage after SCI (). In SCI and MS patients, myelin speciﬁc proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) signiﬁcantly increase the population of circulating T cells (, ). Moreover, serological assessment of SCI patients has shown high levels of CNS reactive IgM and IgG isotypes conﬁrming SCI-induced autoimmune activity of T and B cells (Figure ) (, , ). In animal models of SCI, serum IgM level increases acutely followed by an elevation in the levels of IgG and IgGa at later time-points (). In addition to autoantibody production, autoreactive B cells contribute to CNS injury through pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that stimulate and maintain the activation states of Teﬀ cells (, ). B cell knockout mice (BCKO) that have no mature B cell but with normal T cells, show a reduction in lesion volume, lower antibody levels in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and improved recovery of function following SCI compared to wild-type counterparts (). Of note, antibody mediated injury is regulated through complement activation as well as macrophages/microglia that express immunoglobulin receptors (, ). The eﬀect of SCI on systemic B cell response is controversial. Evidence shows that SCI can suppress B cell activation and antibody production (). Studies in murine SCI have shown that B cell function seems to be inﬂuenced by the level of injury (). While injury to upper thoracic spinal cord (T) suppresses the antibody production, a mid-thoracic (T) injury has no eﬀect on B cell antibody production (). An increase in the level of corticosterone in serum together with elevation of splenic norepinephrine found to be responsible for the suppression of B cell function acutely following SCI (). Elevated corticosterone and norepinephrine leads to upregulation of lymphocyte beta-
 adrenergic receptors eliciting lymphocyte apoptosis (). This suggests a critical role for sympathetic innervation of Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury peripheral lymphoid tissues in regulating B cell response following CNS injury (). Despite their negative roles, B cells also contribute to spinal cord repair following injury through their immunomodulatory Breg phenotype (Figure ) (). Breg cells control antigen-speciﬁc T cell autoimmune response through ILproduction (). Detrimental eﬀects of SCI-induced autoimmunity are not limited to the spinal cord. Autoreactive immune cells contribute to the exacerbation of post-SCI sequelae such as cardiovascular, renal and reproductive dysfunctions (). For example, presence of an autoantibody against platelet prostacyclin receptor has been associated with a higher incidence of coronary artery disease in SCI patients (). Collectively, evidence shows the critical role of adaptive immune system in SCI pathophysiology and repair. Thus, treatments that harness the pro-regenerative properties of the adaptive immune system can be utilized to reduce immune mediated tissue damage, improve neural tissue preservation and facilitate repair following SCI. Glial Scar and Extracellular Matrix Traumatic SCI triggers the formation of a glial scar tissue around the injury epicenter (, ). The glial scar is a multifactorial phenomenon that is contributed f several populations in the injured spinal cord including activated astrocytes, NG+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), microglia, ﬁbroblasts, and pericytes (–). The heterogeneous scar forming cells and associated ECM provides a cellular and biochemical zone within and around the lesion (Figure ) (). Resident and inﬁltrating inﬂammatory cells contribute to the process of glial activation and scar formation by producing cytokines (e.g., ILβ and IL-) chemokines and enzymes that activate glial cells or disrupt BSB (). Activated microglia/macrophages produce proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that increase vascular permeability and further disruption of the BSB (). Inhibition of MMPs improves neural preservation and functional recovery in animal models of SCI (–). In addition to glial and immune cells, ﬁbroblasts, pericytes and ependymal cells also contribute to the structure of the glial scar (). In penetrating injuries where meninges are compromised, meningeal ﬁbroblasts inﬁltrate the lesion epicenter (). Fibroblasts contribute to the production of ﬁbronectin, collagen, and laminin in the ECM of the inured spinal cord () and are a source of axon-repulsing molecules such as semaphorins that inﬂuence axonal regeneration following SCI (). Fibroblasts have also been found in contusive injuries where meninges are intact (, ). Studies using genetic fate mapping in these injuries have unraveled that perivascular pericytes and ﬁbroblasts migrate to the injury site and form a ﬁbrotic core in the scar which matures within  weeks post-injury (, ). SCI also triggers proliferation and migration of the stem/progenitor cell pool of the spinal cord parenchyma and ependyma. These cells can give rise to new scar forming astrocytes and OPCs (–). In a mature glial scar, activated microglia/macrophages occupy the innermost portion closer to the injury epicenter surrounded by NG+ OPCs (Figure ) (), while reactive astrocytes reside in the injury penumbra and form a cellular barrier (). Of note, in human SCI, the glial scar begins to form within the ﬁrst hours after the SCI and remains chronically in the spinal cord tissue (). The glial scar has been found within the injured human spinal cord up to  years after the injury (). Activated astrocytes play a leading role in the formation of the glial scar (). Following injury, astrocytes increase their expression of intermediate ﬁlaments, GFAP, nestin and vimentin, and become hypertrophied (, ). Reactive astrocytes proliferate and mobilize to the site of injury and form a mesh like structure of intermingled ﬁlamentous processes around the injury epicenter (, ). The astrocytic glial scar has been shown to serve as a protective barrier that prevents the spread of inﬁltrating immune cells into the adjacent segments (, , ). Attenuating astrocyte reactivity and scar formation by blockade of STAT activation results in poorer outcomes in SCI (, ). Reactive astrogliosis is also essential for reconstruction of the BBB, and blocking this process leads to exacerbated leukocyte inﬁltration, cell death, myelin damage, and reduced functional recovery (, , ). Despite the protective role of the astrocytic glial scar in acute SCI, its evolution and persistence in the sub-acute and chronic stages of injury has been considered as a potent inhibitor for spinal cord repair and regeneration (, ). A number of inhibitory molecules have been associated with activated astrocytes and their secreted products such as proteoglycans and Tenascin-C (). Thus, manipulation of the astrocytic scar has been pursued as a promising treatment strategy for SCI (, ). Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are well-known for their contribution to the inhibitory role of the glial scar in axonal regeneration (–), sprouting (–), conduction (–), and remyelination (, –). In normal condition, basal levels of CSPGs are expressed in the CNS that play critical roles in neuronal guidance and synapse stabilization (, ). Following injury, CSPGs (neurocan, versican, brevican, and phosphacan) are robustly upregulated and reach their peak of expression at  weeks post-SCI and remain upregulated chronically (, ). Mechanistically, disruption of BSB and hemorrhage following traumatic SCI triggers upregulation of CSPGs in the glial scar by exposing the scar forming cells to factors in plasma such as ﬁbrinogen (). Studies in cortical injury have shown that ﬁbrinogen induces CSPG expression in astrocytes through TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway (). The authors show that intracellular Smad translocation is essential for Smad signal transduction process and its inhibition reduces scar formation (). In contrast, another study has identiﬁed that TGFβ induces CSPGs production in astrocytes through a SMAD independent pathway (). This study showed a signiﬁcant upregulation of CSPGs in SMAD and SMAD knockdown astrocytes. Interestingly, CSPG upregulation was found to be mediated by the activation of the phosphoinositide -kinase (PIK)/Akt and mTOR axis (). Further studies are required to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Extensive research in the past few decades has demonstrated the inhibitory eﬀect of CSPGs on axon regeneration (, ). The ﬁrst successful attempt on improving axon outgrowth and/or sprouting by enzymatic degradation of CSPGs using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) in a rat SCI model was published in  by Bradbury and colleagues (). This Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury study showed signiﬁcant improvement in recovery of locomotor and proprioceptive functions following intrathecal delivery of ChABC in a rat model of dorsal column injury (). This observation was followed by several other studies demonstrating the promise of CSPGs degradation in improvement of axon regeneration and sprouting of the serotonergic (, , , ), sensory (, , ), corticospinal (, , , ), and rubrospinal ﬁbers () in animal models of CNS injury. Additionally, ChABC treatment is shown to be neuroprotective by preventing CSPG induced axonal dieback and degeneration (, , ). Studies by our group also showed that degradation of CSPGs using ChABC attenuates axonal dieback in corticospinal ﬁbers in chronic SCI model in the rat (). ChABC also blocks macrophage-mediated axonal degeneration in neural cultures and after SCI (). The inhibitory eﬀects of astrocytic glial scar on axonal regeneration has been recently challenged after SCI (). Using various transgenic mouse models, a study by Sofroniew’s and colleagues has shown that spontaneous axon regrowth failed to happen following the ablation or prevention of astrocytic scar in acute and chronic SCI. They demonstrated that when the intrinsic ability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons for growth was enhanced by pre-conditioning injury as well as local delivery of a combination of axon growth promoting factors into the SCI lesion, the axons grew to the wall of the glial scar and CSPGs within the lesion. However, when astrocyte scarring was attenuated, the pre-conditioned/growth factor stimulated DRG neurons showed a reduced ability for axon growth (). From these observations, the authors suggested a positive role for the astrocytic scar in axonal regeneration following SCI (). Overall, this study points to the importance of reactive and scar forming astrocytes and their pivotal role in the repair process following SCI (). This is indeed in agreement with previous studies by the same group that showed a beneﬁcial role for activated astrocytes in functional recovery after SCI by limiting the speared of inﬁltrated inﬂammatory cells and tissue damage in SCI (). It is also noteworthy that the glial scar is contributed by various cell populations and not exclusively by astrocytes (, ). Therefore, the outcomes of this study need to be interpreted in the context of astrocytes and astrocytic scar. Moreover, the reduced capacity of the injured spinal cord for regeneration is not solely driven by the glial scar as other factors including inﬂammation and damaged myelin play important inhibitory role in axon regeneration (, ). Taken together, further investigation is needed to delineate the mechanisms of the glial scar including the contribution of astrocyte-derived factors on axon regeneration in SCI. Role of CSPGs on Endogenous Cell Response and Neuroinﬂammation While CSPGs were originally identiﬁed as an inhibitor of axon growth and plasticity within the glial scar, emerging evidence has also identiﬁed them as an important regulator of endogenous cell response. Emerging evidence has identiﬁed CSPGs as an inhibitor of oligodendrocytes (, , ). Replacement of oligodendrocytes is an important repair process in SCI and other demyelinating conditions such as MS (). SCI and MS triggers activation of endogenous OPCs and their mobilization to the site of injury (, , , ). In vitro and in vivo evidence shows that CSPGs limit the recruitment of NPCs and OPCs to the lesion and inhibit oligodendrocyte survival, diﬀerentiation and maturation (, , , , ). Our group and others have shown that targeting CSPGs by ChABC administration or xyloside, or through inhibition of their signaling receptors enhances the capacity of NPCs and OPCs for proliferation, oligodendrocyte diﬀerentiation and remyelination following SCI and MS-like lesions (, , , ). Mechanistically, the inhibitory eﬀects of CSPGs on axon growth and endogenous cell diﬀerentiation is mainly governed by signaling through receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (RPTPσ) and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase receptor (LAR) (). RPTPσ is the main receptor mediating the inhibition of axon growth by CSPGs (, ). Improved neuronal regeneration has been demonstrated in RPTPσ–/– mice model of SCI and peripheral nerve injury (, ). Blockade of RPTPσ and LAR by intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) and intracellular LAR peptide (ILP), facilitates axon regeneration following SCI (, ). Inhibition of RPTPσ results in signiﬁcant improvement in locomotion and bladder function associated with serotonergic re-innervation below the level of injury in rat SCI (). Our group has also shown that CSPGs induce caspasemediated apoptosis in NPCs and OPCs in vitro and in oligodendrocytes in the injured spinal cord that is mediated by both RPTPσ and LAR (). Inhibition of LAR and RPTPσ suﬃciently attenuates CSPG-mediated inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in vitro and attenuated oligodendrocyte cell death after SCI (). CSPGs have been implicated in regulating immune response in CNS injury and disease. Interestingly, our recent studies indicated that CSPGs signaling appears to restrict endogenous repair by promoting a pro-inﬂammatory immune response in SCI (, ). Inhibition of LAR and RPTPσ enhanced an anti-inﬂammatory environment after SCI by promoting the populations of pro-regenerative M-like microglia/macrophages and regulatory T cells () that are known to promote repair process (). These ﬁndings are also in agreement with recent studies in animal models of MS that unraveled a proinﬂammatory role for CSPGs in autoimmune demyelinating conditions (). In MS and EAE, studies by Stephenson and colleagues have shown that CSPGs are abundant within “the leucocyte-containing perivascular cuﬀ,” the entry point of inﬂammatory cells to the CNS tissue (). Presence of CSPGs in these perivascular cuﬀs promotes “traﬃcking” of immune cells to induce a pro-inﬂammatory response in MS condition. In contrast to these new ﬁndings, early studies in SCI described that preventing CSPG formation with xyloside treatment at the time of injury results in poor functional outcome, while manipulation of CSPGs at  days after SCI was beneﬁcial for functional recovery (). These diﬀerential outcomes were associated with the modulatory role of CSPGs in regulating the response of macrophages/microglia. Disruption in CSPG formation immediately after injury promoted an M pro-inﬂammatory Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org March  | Volume  | Article 
Alizadeh et al. Overview of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury phenotype in macrophages/microglia, whereas delayed manipulation of CSPGs resulted in a pro-regenerative M phenotype (). In EAE, by products of CSPG degradation also improve the outcomes by attenuating T cell inﬁltration and their expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNFα (). These emerging ﬁndings suggest an important immunomodulatory role for CSPGs in CNS injury and disease; further investigations are needed to elucidate CSPG mechanisms in regulating neuroinﬂammation. Altogether, current evidence has identiﬁed a multifaceted inhibitory role for CSPGs in regulating endogenous repair mechanisms after SCI, suggesting that targeting CSPGs may present a promising treatment strategy for SCI. CONCLUDING REMARKS Traumatic SCI represents a heterogeneous and complex pathophysiology. While pre-clinical research on SCI has been an ongoing endeavor for over a century, our understanding of SCI mechanisms has been increased remarkably over the past few decades. This is mainly due to the development of new transgenic and preclinical animal models that has facilitated rapid discoveries in SCI mechanisms. Although SCI research has made an impressive advancement, much work is still needed to translate the gained knowledge from animal studies to clinical applications in humans.

Table of Contents S P I N A L  C O R D  I N J U R Y :   B A S I C  FA C T S Spinal Cord Injury:  Basic Facts Spinal cord injury occurs when there is any damage to the spinal cord that 
blocks communication between the brain and the body. After a spinal cord 
injury, a person’s sensory, motor and reflex messages are affected and may 
not be able to get past the damage in the spinal cord. In general, the higher 
on the spinal cord the injury occurs, the more dysfunction the person will 
experience. Injuries are referred to as complete or incomplete, based on 
whether any movement and sensation occurs at or below the level of injury. The most important – and sometimes frustrating – thing to know is that 
each person’s recovery from spinal cord injury is different. CAUSES Traumatic injuries Motor vehicle accidents 
Football Falls 
Gymnastics Violence 
Diving into shallow water Spinal cord injuries affect more men than women. The majority of people 
who sustain a spinal cord injury are young adults between the ages of  
and  because of riskier behaviors. Non-traumatic injuries/illnesses Cancer 
Osteoporosis Multiple sclerosis 
Inflammation of the spinal cord Arthritis Continued on Next Page U N D E R S TA N D I N G  S P I N A L  C O R D  I N J U R Y EFFECTS The effects of spinal cord injury may include the following: 
Loss of movement 
Loss of sensation Loss of bowel and/or bladder control Exaggerated reflex actions or spasms Changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility Pain or intense stinging sensation Spinal Cord Injury: Basic Facts Continued from Page 
When a spinal cord injury occurs, sensation and 
movement may be interrupted, resulting in a 
temporary or permanent loss of function, paralysis and loss of sensation. Here are some basic 
anatomy facts: n The brain is surrounded by the skull. n The spinal cord is surrounded by rings of bone called vertebrae. n Both are covered by a protective membrane. 
n Together, the vertebrae and the membrane make up the spinal column, or backbone. n The backbone, which protects the spinal cord, starts at the base of the skull and ends just above the hips.  
n The spinal cord is about  inches long. It extends from the base of the brain, down the middle of the back, to just 
below the last rib in the waist area. n The main job of the spinal cord is to be the communication 
system between the brain and the body by carrying 
messages that allow people to move and feel sensation. 
n Spinal nerve cells, called neurons, carry messages to and 
from the spinal cord, via spinal nerves. n Messages carried by the spinal nerves leave the spinal 
cord through openings in the vertebrae. 
n Spinal nerve roots branch off the spinal cord in pairs, 
one going to each side of the body. 
n Every nerve has a special job for movement and feeling. 
They tell the muscles in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, 
toes, chest and other parts of the body how and when 
to move. They also carry messages back to the brain 
about sensations, such as pain, temperature and touch.

The higher the injury on the spinal cord, the more dysfunction can occur. High-Cervical Nerves (C – C) n Most severe of the spinal cord injury levels n Paralysis in arms, hands, trunk and legs n Patient may not be able to breathe on his or 
her own, cough, or control bowel or bladder 
movements. n Ability to speak is sometimes impaired or 
reduced. n When all four limbs are affected, this is called tetraplegia or quadriplegia. n Requires complete assistance with activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, bathing, 
and getting in or out of bed n May be able to use powered wheelchairs with special controls to move around on their own n Will not be able to drive a car on their own n Requires -hour-a-day personal care Levels of Injury C C C C C C C C L E V E L S  O F  I N J U R Y Low-Cervical Nerves (C – C) n Corresponding nerves control arms and hands. n A person with this level of injury may be able to breathe on their own and 
speak normally. n C injury o Person can raise his or her arms and bend elbows. o Likely to have some or total paralysis of wrists, hands, trunk and legs o Can speak and use diaphragm, but breathing will be weakened o Will need assistance with most activities of daily living, but once in a 
power wheelchair, can move from one place to another independently n C injury o Nerves affect wrist extension. o Paralysis in hands, trunk and legs, typically o Should be able to bend wrists back o Can speak and use diaphragm, but breathing will be weakened o Can move in and out of wheelchair and bed with assistive equipment o May also be able to drive an adapted vehicle o Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but may be able to 
manage on their own with special equipment n C injury o Nerves control elbow extension and some finger extension. o Most can straighten their arm and have normal movement of  
their shoulders. o Can do most activities of daily living by themselves, but may need 
assistance with more difficult tasks o May also be able to drive an adapted vehicle o Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but may be able to 
manage on their own with special equipment n C injury o Nerves control some hand movement. o Should be able to grasp and release objects o Can do most activities of daily living by themselves, but may need 
assistance with more difficult tasks o May also be able to drive an adapted vehicle o Little or no voluntary control of bowel or bladder, but may be able to

Emotional stages you will probably experience are: first, denial 
and disbelief; second, sadness, anger and bargaining; and third and 
most important, acceptance. It’s natural and important to grieve the loss of the way things were before 
the injury. It’s also necessary to set new goals and find a way to move forward 
with your life. As you begin to accept the consequences of what has happened, you can 
start to plan how to make the best of the challenge you’re facing. Your relationships with family and friends will be tested, you may feel overwhelmed or try to go on like nothing has changed. Everyone copes with these 
feelings in different ways. With time and support, you’ll begin to adjust to the 
challenge of spinal cord injury and understand your “new normal.” As you go 
through this process, be sure to: n Empower yourself with as much knowledge as you can. n Check out local and state support groups, as well as nationally recognized 
spinal cord injury organizations, such as the National Spinal Cord Injury 
Association, The American Trauma Society and the Christopher & Dana 
Reeve Foundation.

with more than half occurring after trauma. In Brazil, few studies have evaluated the epidemiology of SCI with an estimated 
incidence of  to  per million per year. With the aging of 
the population, the incidence is expected to increase, mainly 
due to fall-related injuries. Direct lifetime costs can be as high 
as $.-$. million per patient, and the consequences for the 
patients and their families can be devastating,. Search strategy A PubMed search for articles published up to September 
 was performed using the terms “Spinal Cord Injury” [Mesh] 
and (“traumatic” [Title/Abstract]), which returned , articles. 
Additionally, the reference lists of the most recent guidelines on 
the management of spinal cord injury were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the article titles and abstracts. Articles 
with at least one abstract in English or Portuguese were searched. Pathophysiology The initial primary trauma causes mechanical injury to 
the spinal cord, a combination of compression, laceration, 
distraction or shearing. After the resulting damage to the 
microvasculature, progressive edema develops, ongoing ischemia worsens and a pro-apoptotic signaling is initiated. There 
is disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, influx of inflammatory cells, vasoactive peptides, and release of coagulation 
factors. These events promote thrombosis and spasm of the 
microvessels, leading to further hypoxia. An energetic crisis 
is installed, there is production of oxygen free radicals, and 
excitotoxicity and cytotoxic edema develop. With loss of the 
parenchymal volume, cystic cavities coalesce, generating a 
physical barrier to cell migration. Because of the distortion 
of the structural framework, regenerative attempts do not 
succeed. Proliferation of astrocytes and deposition of fibroblasts worsen the picture. The Rho-ROCK (rho-associated

the epidemiology of SCI with an estimated incidence of  to  per million per year. The final extent of the spinal cord damage results from 
primary and secondary mechanisms that start at the moment of the injury and go on for days, and even weeks, after the event. There is convincing 
evidence that hypotension contributes to secondary injury after acute SCI. Surgical decompression aims at relieving mechanical pressure on the 
microvascular circulation, therefore reducing hypoxia and ischemia. The role of methylprednisolone as a therapeutic option is still a matter of 
debate, however most guidelines do not recommend its regular use. Neuroprotective therapies aiming to reduce further injury have been studied 
and many others are underway. Neuroregenerative therapies are being extensively investigated, with cell based therapy being very promising. Keywords: spinal cord injuries; spinal cord compression; neurosurgery; spinal cord regeneration; celland tissue-based therapy. RESUMO O traumatismo raquimedular (TRM) afeta . milhão de norte americanos, sendo mais da metade secundário a trauma.No Brasil, pouco estudos 
avaliaram sistematicamente a epidemiologia do TRM, mas estima-se uma incidência de  a  por milhão por ano. A extensão final do dano 
medular é resultante de mecanismos primários e secundários, que começam no momento do evento e prosseguem por dias e até semanas 
seguintes. Há fortes evidências de que a hipotensão contribua para danos secundários pós TRM. A cirurgia descompressiva visa a aliviar a 
compressão mecânica sobre a microcirculação, assim reduzindo isquemia e hipóxia. O papel da metilprednisolona no tratamento de pacientes 
com TRM é controverso, não sendo recomandada pela maior parte das diretrizes atuais. Terapias neuroprotetoras visando a reduzir injúria

Together, all those mechanisms contribute to the restriction 
of regeneration,. 
The final extent of spinal cord damage results from 
primary and secondary mechanisms that start at the 
moment of the injury and go on for days and even weeks. 
Neuroprotective agents attempt to avert specific secondary injuries and prevent neural damage, while neuroregenerative therapies act to promote axonal regrowth after the 
damage has occured. Neurological classification After initial general stabilization, it is important to perform a thorough neurological examination. The American 
Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standard for neurological 
and functional classification is the recommended preferred 
tool. It is important as a means of standardizing the initial 
and follow-up examinations, and also has a role in predicting 
the prognosis. The tool consists of two components, the sensitive and 
the motor. The sensitive component comprises the testing of 
a key point in each of the  dermatomes (from C to S-) 
on the right and left sides. Light touch and pinprick sensation 
are also tested. Each modality is separately scored on a threepoint scale, ranging from  (absent) to  (normal or intact). 
The motor examination encompasses testing of key 
muscle functions corresponding to ten paired myotomes 
(C-T and L-S). Voluntary external anal sphincter 
contraction should also be tested. The strength should be 
graded according to the Medical Research Council grading 
system, from  to . 
With that, the neurological level of injury is determined 
as the most caudal segment of the cord with intact sensation 
and antigravity muscle function strength (Figure ). 
The ASIA Impairment Scale should be determined, as follows: A = complete. No sensory or motor functions in sacral 
segments S-S. B = sensory incomplete. Sensory but not motor function 
is preserved below the neurological level of injury including 
S-S and no motor function is preserved more than three 
levels below the motor level on each side of the body. C = motor complete. Motor function is preserved below 
the neurological level, and more than half the muscles 
below the neurological level of injury have a  muscle grade 
less than . D = motor incomplete. Motor function is preserved below 
the neurological level, and at least half the muscles below the 
neurological level of injury have a muscle grade > . E = Normal. Sensation and motor functions are normal in 
all segments tested. As previously mentioned, the ASIA Impairment Scale 
score has a prognostic value. Eighty-five percent of ASIA 
A patients will not regain function. Of the % who will 
improve, only % will have useful motor function. More 
than half (%) ASIA B patients, and the vast majority (%) 
of ASIA C-D patients will regain function. MOTOR C elbow ﬂexors C wrist extensors C elbow extensors C ﬁnger ﬂexors T ﬁnger abductors Upper limb maximum

American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Standard Neurological classification of spinal cord injury. Steps of required 
motor and sensory examinations. Rouanet C et al. Traumatic spinal cord injury Imaging According to the last SCI guideline, trauma patients who 
have complaints of neck pain, spinal tenderness, symptoms 
or signs of a neurological deficit related to the spine, and 
patients who cannot be clearly assessed (the ones who are 
unconscious, uncooperative, incoherent or intoxicated) need 
a radiographic study of the spinal cord. 
The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study 
(NEXUS) protocol was designed as an attempt to identify those 
at low risk for cervical fracture/subluxation/dislocation. It 
consists of five criteria: no posterior midline cervical tenderness, no intoxication, normal mental status, no other painful 
injuries and no neurological deficits. Patients meeting all of 
these criteria are at low risk of cervical injury and imaging of 
the neck or the spinal cord can be waived. The NEXUS protocol has a sensitivity of % and a negative predictive value of 
.% for cervical spinal cord injuries. Another protocol addressing the same issue is the 
Canadian C-Spine Rule, which consists of three questions: 
the presence of a high-risk factor that mandates radiography 
(age >  years, dangerous mechanism of trauma, or paresthesias in extremities), the presence of low risk factors allowing safe assessment of the range of motion, and the ability to 
actively rotate the neck º to the left and right. The use of 
the Canadian C-Spine Rule protocol resulted in % sensitivity for cervical spinal injury with a .% specificity. The imaging modality of choice is computed tomography 
(CT). If it is not available, a three-view spine x-ray is recommended (anteroposterior, odontoid and lateral views), being 
supplemented later by a CT scan. Magnetic resonance imaging should be obtained, when 
feasible, in the first  hours after the trauma. It can detect 
lesions in % of the cases in which the CT is normal, and is 
particularly useful for ligamentous lesions. It is also a valuable 
tool to classify severity and predict outcome based on the presence of hemorrhage, extent of edema, and severity of the initial 
compression. Intraspinal hemorrhages (> cm long) as well as 
longitudinal T signal changes > cm, are associated with poor 
prognosis. A normal initial magnetic resonance image is usually associated with complete recovery. 
Airway management Respiratory complications are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the acute phase of the SCI, with incidence ranging from % to %. Reduced vital capacity, 
retention of secretions, and autonomic dysfunction all play 
a role. Up to two thirds of patients will have complications 
such as atelectasis, pneumonia, or respiratory failure that 
require mechanical ventilation. The injury level and the ASIA classification are the 
two most important predictors for the need of intubation. 
Virtually % of lesions above C require intubation (the 
phrenic nerve originates from C-C), which should be performed electively rather than as an emergency. It is important 
to avoid hyperextension, rotation, and other movements of 
the neck during intubation. When possible, awake, fiberoptic 
intubation is preferred. In-line stabilization without traction 
is an alternative when a fiber optic laryngoscope or bronchoscope is unavailable.  
In selected patients with complete cervical lesions or in 
those with incomplete or lower lesions, conservative management might be an option. In such cases, lung function 
should be monitored closely with vital capacity, maximum 
inspiratory pressure and carbon dioxide partial pressure levels. Those measures can predict the need for intubation. With regard to ventilator weaning, only % of patients 
with lesions above C are successfully extubated. Predictors 
of the need for tracheostomy are ASIA A lesions, extent of 
the lesion, smoking, and previous lung disease. Some studies 
advocate that early tracheostomy (within  days) in these 
patients leads to a shorter ICU stay and reduction in the 
length of time of mechanical ventilation. Cardiovascular management Hypotension after SCI is frequent. It may be due to hypovolemia in a context of polytrauma, or due to the direct cervical or thoracic spinal trauma itself, leading to neurogenic 
shock. Neurogenic shock results from the interruption of 
sympathetic tone due to disruption in supraspinal control, 
and an intact parasympathetic influence via the vagus nerve, 
leading to an imbalance in the autonomic control. There is, 
therefore, loss of peripheral vascular tone and bradycardia. 
Although the deleterious consequences of hypotension in 
SCI have not been assessed in a controlled prospective way, 
there is convincing evidence that hypotension contributes to 
secondary injury after acute SCI, reducing spinal cord flow 
and perfusion. Based on this, the current recommendation is 
to strictly avoid hypotension, and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at -mmHg for seven days after injury (level 
III evidence). In order to achieve that goal, the mainstay of 
treatment is intravenous fluid therapy (mainly with crystalloids) to maintain a euvolemic or slightly hypervolemic status, 
in association with vasopressors. It is important to have invasive blood pressure monitoring with an arterial line. 
The main predictors of poor cardiovascular function 
requiring resuscitation and support are high cervical and 
complete lesions. Cardiovascular instability may be transient and episodic, but can also be recurrent in the first 
– days after injury. The best vasoactive amine is still a matter of debate. 
The last guideline does not address this controversy. A systematic review tried to answer several questions regarding 
the use of vasopressors in acute SCI. However, it was inconclusive in determining which vasopressor is better, what the 
optimal therapy duration is and what the MAP level is below 
which one should initiate vasopressor support. 
The vasopressor selection may depend on the level of the 
SCI and on the patient’s hemodynamics. In cervical or high 
Arq Neuropsiquiatr ;():thoracic lesions with both hypotension and bradycardia, 
a drug with chronotropic and inotropic effects as well as vasoconstrictor properties might be required. Norepinephrine 
(or alternatively, dopamine) could be good options. For low 
thoracic lesions, where hypotension is usually the result of 
peripheral vasodilation, a pure vasopressor drug such as 
phenylephrine could be appropriate. 
Recently, some studies have addressed the frequency of 
side effects and rates of complications related to the use of 
vasoactive drugs in this population. A high rate of cardiogenic 
complications was found, with up to % of patients experiencing at least one of the following: tachycardia, bradycardia, 
elevated troponin, new onset atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, 
or eletrocardiogram ST changes consistent with ischemia. 
A higher rate of side effects with the use of dopamine compared to norepinephrine and phenylephrine was described, 
especially in the population older than – years,,. Recently, Altaf and collaborators compared the effects 
of norepinephrine versus dopamine on MAP, the intrathecal pressure (monitored with a lumbar intrathecal catheter) 
and spinal cord pressure perfusion (the difference between 
MAP and intrathecal pressure). The conclusion was that 
norepinephrine was able to maintain MAP with a lower 
intrathecal pressure and correspondingly higher spinal cord 
pressure perfusion. These findings have led to a non-inferiority trial design 
called the “Mean Arterial Blood Pressure Treatment for 
Acute Spinal Cord Injury”, comparing the avoidance of hypotension (MAP ≥ mmHg) versus the induction of hypertension (MAP ≥ mmHg), which is currently recruiting patients 
and is expected to be completed in . Decompressive Surgery Progressive edema and hemorrhage contribute to the 
ongoing mechanical pressure on the microvascular circulation. Surgical decompression aims to relieve this pressure, 
thereby reducing secondary hypoxia and ischemia. Indications for surgery include significant cord compression with progressive neurological impairment and a fracture 
not amenable to, or not responding to, close reduction, such 
as unstable vertebral fractures. The Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study 
was a prospective, observational study that compared 
patients who had undergone surgery before and after  
hours from injury. The first group was more than twice as 
likely to have a two grade ASIA Impairment Scale improvement and a similar complication rate compared to the 
group with late surgery. Those findings were confirmed in a prospective Canadian 
cohort study even after adjusting for preoperative status and 
neurological level. With that, the concept of “time is spine” has emerged, and 
the ongoing recommendation is surgical decompression in 
the first  hours. The SCI-POEM is a European multicenter study that is 
currently recruiting patients with the aim to compare decompression < hours versus >  hours until  days. The final 
report is planned to be published in the end of . Intravenous methylprednisolone Methyprednisolone (MP) is a synthetic corticosteroid 
that upregulates anti-inflammatory factors and decreases 
oxidative stress, enhancing endogenous cell survival in animal models of SCI. It reduces edema, prevents intracellular 
potassium depletion and inhibits lipid peroxidation. Since the s, clinical trials have been trying to demonstrate its benefits in humans. The National Spinal Cord Injury 
Study I, published in , examined mg bolus MP followed by the same dose daily for  days, compared to mg 
bolus and then daily. No difference in motor or sensitive neurological recovery was observed between groups, and wound 
infections were more prevalent in the high-dose group.  
The National Spinal Cord Injury Study II, published in 
, compared MP mg/kg intravenously followed by 
. mg/kg/h over  hours to naloxone and placebo. At one 
year, there was no significant difference in neurological function among the groups. A subanalysis found that the subset of patients who received the corticosteroid within eight 
hours had a modest improvement in motor recovery. Wound 
infections were more frequent among MP patients. The National Spinal Cord Injury Study III, published in 
, compared three treatment groups: MP for  hours, the 
same drug administered for  hours and tirilazad mesylate 
(a potent lipid peroxidation inhibitor). Patients were treated 
within eight hours of SCI. In a post hoc analysis, in patients 
treated between three to eight hours from trauma, the 
-hour regimen was associated with a greater motor, but 
not functional, recovery. In addition, the group with the longer duration had more severe sepsis and pneumonia. 
Recently, a meta-analysis and systematic review concluded that evidence from multiple randomized controlled 
trials and also from observational studies do not support 
methylprednisolone use in acute SCI since it has no long-term 
benefits. Besides, it increases gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
and has a trend to increase overall adverse events. The last consensus does not recommend MP for treatment of SCI. Neuroprotection Neuroprotective agents aiming to reduce secondary insults 
are potential key therapies in SCI. Multiple approaches have 
been studied, and many others are currently under investigation. Gangliosides are glycolipid molecules present in neuronal membranes. Laboratory studies have shown that they 
can enhance axonal regeneration, besides having a variety of 
neuroprotective effects, such as prevention of apoptosis and 
anti-excitotoxic activity. GM(Sygen) was suggested as a 
therapeutic option until the  guideline (although without 
Rouanet C et al. Traumatic spinal cord injury demonstrated clinical benefit). However, a randomized 
controlled trial of the ganglioside compound reported no difference in neurological recovery after six months, therefore, 
it is no longer recommended,. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, was tested in the National 
Spinal Cord Injury Study II trial together with MP and placebo. The study was negative, with no differences in motor 
scores between groups. Nimodipine is an L-type calcium channel blocker thought 
to prevent calciumdependent apoptotic enzymes and block 
presynaptic release of glutamate. In comparison with placebo, however, no difference in neurological status at one 
year was noted. Tirilazad mesylate, a drug that attenuates peroxidation of 
neuronal membranes, was analyzed together with MP in the 
National Spinal Cord Injury Study III trial, with no difference 
between groups. There are no placebo-controlled studies. In animal studies, hypothermia decreased basal metabolic rate in the central nervous system, reduced inflammation, apoptosis, excitotoxicity, edema, gliosis, and increased 
angiogenesis. As well, traumatic SCI models showed 
improvement with the decreased temperature. A small pilot 
study in humans with SCI exposed to hypothermia showed a 
trend towards neurological recovery (% vs %) and no difference in complication rates. Another study evaluated  
ASIA A patients who were treated with hypothermia (ºC) 
for  hours, starting in the first six hours post-injury. Four 
patients converted to ASIA B in the first  hours. In the 
remaining patients, .% showed an improvement of at 
least one grade on the ASIA scale at the latest follow-up. 
These promising results led to a phase II/III trial named 
“The Acute Rapid Cooling Therapy for Injuries of the Spinal 
Cord”. This study (which is not yet recruiting) plans to evaluate different durations of hypothermia, starting within six 
hours post-trauma. Riluzole, a sodium-channel blocker, reduces secondary injury by blocking pathological activation of sodium 
channels and reducing the release of glutamate in preclinical models of SCI. A phase I/II trial demonstrated a benefit 
in motor scores in patients treated with the drug. A phase 
II/III trial, the Riluzole in Spinal Cord Injury Study, is ongoing, to evaluate the aforementioned drug in cervical lesions. 
It will be completed in . Minocycline is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory 
properties including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor 
alpha, interleukin  beta, cyclooxygenaseand nitric oxide 
synthase. In pre-clinical models, it decreased lesions sizes 
and neuron loss. In a phase II study, the ASIA motor score 
improved in patients treated with minocycline (p = .). 
This led to a phase III trial, the Minocycline in Acute Spinal 
Cord Injury, which is currently recruiting patients until . 
*Paralysis TMPtC: Neuroprotection: therapeutic hypothermia; . Assessed August . Fibroblast growth factor has been shown to protect 
against excitotoxicity and to reduce free radical production 
in animal models of SCI. A fibroblast growth factor analogue 
called SUN  was evaluated in a phase I/II trial completed in , but results are still pending. Cytokine granulocyte colony stimulating factor is neuroprotective in SCI by promoting cell survival and inhibiting tumor 
necrosis factor alpha and interleukin  beta. There were two 
small, non-randomized studies that demonstrated improvements in ASIA motor scores with the drug use,. 
Neuroregeneration A wide number of strategies are being developed worldwide to help recovery in SCI patients. There are numerous 
targets and therapeutic opportunities using endogenous and 
exogenous repair mechanisms. The aim is to surpass barriers 
to recovery such as the loss of structural framework, cystic 
cavitation, scarring and inhibitory molecular signaling. Cell-based therapies are promising modalities of regeneration. A wide number of cell types have been studied or are 
being evaluated in ongoing studies – embryonic stem cells, 
induced pluripotent stem cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, 
Schwann cells, mesenchymal cells, and activated autologous 
macrophages. In preclinical studies, cellular transplantation 
alone, or in combination with other therapies, was associated with neurological recovery, without any subtype showing superiority over the other. Small human studies also disclosed some degree of improvement, with no major adverse 
events. However, it is important to notice that, independent 
of treatment, most patients will undergo some spontaneous 
recovery in the first six months after injury. Therefore, confounding factors cannot be excluded from these results. Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells are 
capable of remyelinate axons, modulate the inflammatory 
response, regenerate lost neural circuits and modify the 
microenvironment. Schwann cells are able to remyelinate 
central nervous system axons and, in animal models, have 
reduced cystic cavitation, enhanced tissue sparing and 
enhanced recovery. Olfactory ensheathing cells are phagocytes capable of clearing microbes and debris and also of 
secreting neurotropic factors. In animals, they enhanced 
axonal regeneration and remyelination and also improved 
outcomes. Mesenchymal cells can differentiate along their 
connective tissue lineages and modulate inflammatory 
response at systemic and local environment levels. They 
have been shown to decrease inflammatory cell infiltration, increase pro-survival trophic factor levels and promote tissue sparing,. 
It should be noted that cellular transplantation remains 
an investigational and experimental therapy, with no formal 
recommendations.  
Arq Neuropsiquiatr ;():FINAL REMARKS Spinal cord injury management has substantially changed 
over the last years. Key early interventions are increasingly being recognized, as well as the need to better study 
these patients. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative 
strategies are probably more effective when done together, 
and they are an extensive field of current and future 
research. The pending trial results can have a significant 
impact on the standard of care, given that even small 
motor or sensory improvements can have profound effects 
on patients’ lives.

A REVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN SPINAL CORD 
INJURY 
By Dr JOHN D. YEO 
Spinal Injury Unit, Royal North Shore Hospital of Sydney 
Received: September  
IN recent years the long-held beliefs that regeneration in the central nervous 
system does not occur have been questioned. As early as , regeneration 
within the central nervous system of amphibia was reported. The regenerative 
capacity of central nervous tissue has been shown to be greater in embryonic 
and newborn animals. Evidence of intraspinal sprouting in the dorsal root axons 
with the development of new collaterals and preterminals following partial denerva­ tion of the spinal cord was shown in the cat by Lui and Chambers (). 
The difficulties associated with regeneration in central nervous tissue were 
reviewed by Windle (, ). Following injury, the pathogenesis of con­ cussion, contusion and laceration in the spinal cord of man was described by 
Bedbrook (). 
Wolman () reported the results of investigations carried out in  para­ plegics, and detailed the findings at autopsy on each of these patients. Serial 
histological examination of spinal cord sections showed well-developed axon 
regeneration in or near the damaged segments in  of these patients; regeneration 
was demonstrated in spinal cords  months to  years after injury. These 
regenerating axons occurred in small bundles above and below the level of the 
maximum cord damage. The suggested origins of these axons were (i) the dorsal 
columns or (ii) the propriospinal system. It is still uncertain exactly where such 
regenerating fibres terminate or where they make their synapses. 
In , Professor W. F. Windle, addressing the Spinal Cord Injury Con­ ference in the New York University Medical School, stated: 'There is little 
interest at the present time in spinal cord regeneration. The one word most 
commonly associated with this term is "impossible".' 
However, since  a number of institutions have taken up the challenge 
and clarified the pathogenesis of permanent paraplegia in man following a severe 
contusion injury to the spinal cord. Hughes has described the various pathological 
changes in the spinal cord following trauma (). 
In attempting to compare the many reports on experimental spinal cord 
trauma, it is necessary to remember the importance of the reproducible and 
quantitative form of injury. 
There is accumulating evidence that moderate 
contusion of the spinal cord producing either transitory or permanent paraplegia 
results in structural, vascular, physiological and biochemical changes, some of 
which may be reversible (Allen, II; Freeman et al., ; Wolman, ; 
Harvey, ; White et al., ; Ducker et al., ; Tomasula et al., ; 
Ducker, ; Dohrmann, ; Osterholm, , ; Hedeman et al., ; 
Perlman, ; Tator, ; Naftchi et al., ; Yeo et al., ). 
The following is a short chronological review of a number of experimental 
studies carried out to elucidate the pathogenesis of the contusion injury to the 
mammalian spinal cord: 
PARAPLEGIA 
In I. Schmaus was the first to study in the experimental animal, the 
effects of concussion, rather than laceration to the spinal cord. He attached 
wooden boards to the backs of rabbits which were suspended vertically and after 
blows to the boards he reported areas of necrosis cavity formation and cystic 
degeneration (Schmaus, r). 
II. Watson dropped dogs from various heights in a specially constructed 
apparatus but was unable to duplicate the pathological findings reported by 
Schmaus (Watson, r). 
I. Bikeles in a similar experiment confirmed the findings of Schmaus 
(Bikeles, r). 
I. Lugenberger was reported to produce degeneration of the antero­ lateral columns of white matter after contusion to the spinal cords of guinea-pigs 
(Schmaus, ). 
I. Following blows to a rabbit's back, studies by Krichgasser () and 
Scagliosi () demonstrated degeneration in myelin sheaths and in the anterior 
horn cells, although there was no evidence of intramedullary haemorrhage or 
fractures of the vertebral column. 
I. After the injury to the spinal cord by squeezing the cat in a swinging 
door, Spiller () reported degeneration in the anterior and anterolateral 
columns of the white matter. 
I. Stcherbak reported necrosis of the grey matter of the spinal cord after 
the application of a vibrating device (Stcherbak, ). 
III. Allen was probably the first to injure the spinal cord directly when he 
developed a technique which produced an anticipated degree of spinal cord con­ tusion in dogs. Quantitation and standardisation of the lesion was achieved when 
a known weight was dropped within a perpendicular tube from a calculated 
height on to the exposed spinal cord surrounded by intact dura. Allen reported 
that the contusion resulting from a  'grams-centimeter' impact resulted in an 
immediate spastic paraplegia which improved significantly within ten days. By 
increasing the weight to  'grams-centimeter' impact the degree of injury was 
more severe and a complete permanent spastic paraplegia resulted. Allen also 
reported significant recovery in a number of dogs when medial or longitudinal 
myelotomy was performed through the bruised segments. 
Hemorrhage and 
oedema was described in the grey and white matter within  minutes of the 
injury. After four hours, numerous swollen axons appeared in the lateral and 
posterior columns of white matter with increasing haemorrhage and oedema. 
Reducing the intramedullary tension with myelotomy appeared to improve the 
chances of clinical recovery in these animals. He suggested that the development 
of high intramedullary pressure from haemorrhage and oedema produced further 
ischaemic necrosis after the direct injury (Allen, II, ). 
II. D' Abundo studied necrosis of the posterior columns of white matter 
of the spinal cord after centrifuging (D' Abundo, ). 
II. Marinesco described medullary haemorrhages in the spinal cords of 
dogs which had been subjected to explosive forces (Marinesco, ). 
II. Ayer produced compression in the spinal cords of cats by injecting 
paraffin into the epidural space. He reported a normal histological appearance 
apart from some meningeal inflammation although the animals suffered complete 
paraplegia (Ayer, ). 
I. Roussy struck the thoracic vertebral column in guinea-pigs and 
rabbits and described the results of this direct trauma on the myelinated fibres 
(Roussy et al., ). 
REVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN SPINAL 
CORD INJURY 
I. Using dogs, McVeigh produced lesions by compressing the spinal cord 
with a fingertip at the T/T level. He described the formation of oedema in the 
lateral and anterior columns within eight hours of the injury, increasing over 
the following two days. The intramedullary haemorrhage extended along the 
dorsal white columns and in the central grey matter above and below the level 
of the injury (McVeigh, ). 
I. Thompson studied the spinal cords of cats following crushing with 
the tip of a finger and scalpel handle. 
He described a cone-shaped region of 
haemorrhage and degeneration which extended rostrally and caudally (Thompson, 
). 
I. Ferraro administered blows to the backs of rabbits with an iron rod 
and reported swollen axons in the spinal cord developing within one hour, followed 
by alterations in myelin sheaths within  hours. Four days after injury reactive 
gliosis and degeneration in the white matter were evident with changes in the 
anterior horn cells. He attributed the histopathology to shock waves produced 
by the blows and transmitted to the spinal cord by the cerebro-spinal fluid (Ferraro, 
). 
I. Craig inserted pieces of bone wax into the intradural space around 
spinal cord of the cat and reported degeneration in the posterior columns at the 
level of the compression with vacuolation and cystic degeneration extending 
caudally to the compression (Craig, ). 
I. 
Amako, using a modification of Allen's method of impact injury, 
reported immediate haemorrhage in the grey matter with later cavity formation 
in the spinal cords of dogs (Amako, ). 
I. Cats were suspended vertically by Groat et al. () and struck across 
the vertebral column with a board. He reported that the pathological and electro­ physiological changes varied directly with the force employed. 
I. Freeman and Wright claimed that myelotomy of the contused spinal 
cord aided functional return in the experimental animal. They postulated that 
the oedema and haemorrhage caused further compression of the spinal cord 
tissue within the thecal membranes and myelotomy released this pressure (Freeman 
& Wright, ). 
Between I and I. 
Tarlov placed a small hydraulic balloon in the 
epidural space to apply a quantitative compressive force to the spinal cords of 
dogs. Both acute and chronic compression by the epidural balloon produced 
degeneration which extended rostrally and caudally. (Tarlov et at., , ; 
Tarlov, , ). 
I. Gelfan and Tarlov demonstrated that the conduction block following 
compression of the canine spinal cord was reversible. The disturbance of con­ duction appeared secondary to mechanical deformation rather than anoxia (Gelfan 
& Tarlov, ). 
I. 
Kano found that by reducing the cross-sectional area of the canine 
$pinal cord by as little as  per cent he would produce degeneration of ganglion 
tells, nerve fibres and oedema (Kano, ). 
II. Kajiwara and Aikawa secured raqbits within a cylinder and dropped 
:the cylinder from varying distances to study the histopathology of the contused 
:spinal cord. Both authors reported intramedullary haemorrhage and oedema in 
ifihe spinal cord (Kajiwara, K, ; Aikawa, ). 
I. Joyner and Freeman reported clinical improvement in cats when the 
\tSe of an intravenous infusion of urea was given soon after the spinal cord was 
iniured (Joyner & Freeman, ). 
PARAPLEGIA 
. 
Kamiya used intravascular injections of barium sulphate in cats to 
demonstrate the vascular changes which occurred after compression of the anterior 
cervical spinal cord with a variety of epidural devices (Kamiya, ). 
Coe, Calvin and Rudenberg () studied the electrophysiological responses 
of the monkey's spinal cord following cervical flexion compression. 
They 
attributed the immediate loss of the negative deflection of the primary evoked 
response to conduction alteration at the synaptic level in the injured segment of 
the spinal cord. 
Harvey and Srebnik () crushed the spinal cords of rats with thumb 
forceps and reported regeneration of nerve fibres and improvement in locomotion 
in those rats treated with levothyroxine prior to or after injury. 
Scholte () pierced the posterior columns of the spinal cord of rats with 
a razor blade and studied the spinal cord with the electron microscope. Nine 
hours after injury, plasma exudate was evident throughout the grey matter and 
in the extracellular spaces of the white matter. 
Between  and . 
Albin used a modified version of Allen's impact 
injury on the spinal cords of dogs and monkeys. He described oedema which 
rapidly developed, causing the injured cord to swell, and used localised hypo­ thermia within four hours of the injury (Albin et ai., , , , ). 
He demonstrated significant recovery in a series of  animals whose contused 
spinal cords were exposed to cooling under general anaesthesia for three hours 
(Albin, White & Acosta-Rua, ). The cooling process was commenced four 
hours after the injury. Each of  animals in the control group remained para­ plegic. When local hypothermia to the contused spinal cord was delayed for 
eight hours, no significant recovery occurred (Albin, White, Yashon et ai., ). 
. 
Grossman reported abolition of the evoked cortical response one 
minute after the impact injury to the thoracic spinal cord of the dog (Grossman, 
). 
The importance of progressive disturbance of the microvasculature which 
could lead to further local hypoxia was now well recognised, and suggested as a 
reason for extension of the neurological deficit within hours of the spinal cord 
injury (Barnes, ; Schneider, ; Bedbrook, ; Osterholm & Mathews, 
; Vise, Yashon & Hunt, ). With the quantitation of trauma and a known 
pathology profile, proposed methods of treatment could be assessed in the experi­ mental animal. There was now a new emphasis to research physical and chemical 
methods of treatment in an attempt to reduce the pathological changes associated 
with profound paraplegia following the contusion injury to the spinal cord. 
. Ducker and Hamit produced a contusion injury in beagles and reported 
thac parenteral administration of steroids by intramuscular injection was of value 
in preventing permanent paraplegia. They claimed local hypothermia and intra­ muscular steroids were useful to control cord swelling and improve clinical 
recovery, provided treatment was commenced within three hours of injury. 
Although both treated groups of animals improved significantly when compared 
with controls, the degree of recovery was not significantly different between each 
of the treated groups. Intrathecal methyl prednisolone (Depomedrol) also im­ proved the neurological recovery but not as significantly as intramuscular steroids 
(Ducker & Hamit, ). 
Donaghy and Numoto (), using dogs, reported recovery of cortical 
sensory evoked potentials from peroneal nerve stimulation within four hours of 
spinal cord contusion. The rapid return of the evoked potentials indicated future 
recovery of motor function. 
REVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN SPINAL CORD INJURY 
Hartzog et al. () treated the contused spinal cord of the baboon with 
hyperbatic oxygen and reported functional recovery. 
Tomasula et al. () 
reported a series of  cats subjected to a controlled contusion injury to the spinal 
cord. He demonstrated histo-fluorescence in the grey matter beyond the small 
areas of haemorrhage within two minutes of the injury. Fifteen minutes after 
the injury the entire grey matter and the major portion of the white matter was 
fluorescent under ultraviolet light. A study of the sequential pathological changes 
between two minutes and four hours after impact revealed progressive pathology 
and from then on the damage appeared irreparable. At  hours there was a 
total loss of anatomical continuity in the spinal cord tissue. He also reported 
after a survey on the management of experimental spinal cord trauma that the 
best recovery of function occurred after posterior myelotomy. 
Using fluorescent techniques to study the intraspinal circulation in dogs, 
Wagner et al. demonstrated a decrease of as much as  per cent in the blood 
flow through the spinal cord soon after injury (Wagner, a, b). 
Ducker & Assenmacher () and White & Albin (a, b) reporte� 
initial extravasation of erythrocytes following the venous engorgement and 
stasis. 
Coalescence of discreet haemorrhages with ischaemic changes in neurones 
were reported after a sequential pathological study by Goodkin and Campbell 
(). 
I. Kelly reported significant recovery in dogs with contused spinal cords 
after treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (Kelly et al., ). 
Singer, Russell and Coe () reported an abolition of the evoked response 
through the injured portion of the spinal cord within  to  seconds after 
trauma. The response reappeared after  hours. 
II. 
Black and Markowitz () observed that steroids enhanced the 
functional recovery in monkeys, while incision of the dura mater had a deleterious 
effect. Recovery rates were the same in monkeys decompressed with either a 
one or three level laminectomy. 
Ducker and Perot () reported a decrease in intramedullary blood flow 
at one and two hours after contusion. They reported a decrease in spinal cord 
tissue oxygen concentration in the traumatised segment within two to three 
hours. Further description of the intramedullary haemorrhage and oedema of 
the spinal cord was reported in cats by Richardson and Nakamura () using 
the electron microscope. They reported an increase in the size of the basement 
membranes and a swelling of the astrocytic processes with an increase in the 
extracellular space. A combination of local hypothermia and steroids appeared 
to reverse all of these pathological changes. 
Tator () described demyelination largely in the lateral white matter with 
cavitation in the grey over several months after compression of the spinal cord in 
monkeys. 
Wagner, Dohrmann and Bucy (, ) described the leakage of erythro­ cytes into the perivascular space surrounding thin wall vessels in the central grey 
matter. 
Using light microscopy, Yeo, Payne and Collins () reported that white 
matter adjacent to the neural tissue injured directly by impact to the spinal cord 
of the sheep demonstrated progressive swelling of axon fibres and disruption of 
myelin sheaths over four hours. Congestion and extravasation was evident as 
early as  to  minutes and progressed in both white and grey matter over two 
hours. By four hours there appeared to be generalised irreversible damage to 
/I-B 
PARAPLEGIA 
myelinated nerve tissue. Fairholm and Turnbull (, ) as well as Assen­ macher and Ducker () also described coalescence of discreet haemorrhages 
with ischaemic changes occurring in the anterior horn cells. They demonstrated 
non-filling of most small vessels within the central grey and white matter lying 
beneath. 
Locke et al. () described an increase in spinal cord lactate associated 
with ischaemia following contusion injury in monkeys. 
Many other workers, 
including Ducker, Kindt and Kempe (), continued to report on these dynamic 
pathological findings in the acute experimental spinal cord trauma. Dohrmann, 
Wagner and Bucy (Ia, b, c) reported studies of the experimental contusion 
in the spinal cord of the monkey and cat with electron and light microscopy. The 
muscular venules were found to have tears in their walls as early as  minutes 
after the contusion and these tears were identified as the source of some of the 
very early perivascular extravasation. 
By four hours the endothelium of the 
capillaries was swollen, although the walls appeared intact. Within several hours 
after the contusion, ultra-structural alterations in periaxonal spaces and axonal 
degeneration were reported. They also reported the perfusion of grey matter 
was reduced within  minutes and after one hour the blood flow was non-existent. 
Although they described alterations in the blood flow in the white matter within 
one hour of the contusion the blood flow appeared to return to normal within 
 hours. Dohrmann and Wick () reported the transient decrease in blood 
flow in the white matter occurred as early as five minutes and was persistent for 
one hour. 
Fried and Goodkin (), using barium sulphate studies, demonstrated 
progressive lack of perfusion and this severe disturbance of normal haemodynamics 
was still evident  hours after the injury. Turnbull () described the central 
vessels of the spinal cord as susceptible to stretching and compression by a postero­ anterior force. Green and Wagner () reported the development of oedema 
in cats, initially in the grey and later in the white matter, within the first eight 
hours of the injury. After one hour the oedema appeared primarily to involve 
they grey matter but by four hours the white matter immediately adjacent to the 
grey matter was also involved. Within eight hours the entire contused section of 
the spinal cord was described as 'oedematous'. 
Campbell et al. () studied evoked cortical potentials in cats and demon­ strated that, if the potentials were evident within three hours of the injury, recovery 
would follow. 
-. 
Osterholm was the first to suggest that local accumulation of 
noradrenaline following injury could result in further progressive damage to 
neurones adjacent to the nerve tissue damaged by the initial blow. He reported 
a fourfold rise in the level of noradrenaline in the eat's spinal cord within one hour 
of injury. In this period the levels of dopamine were shown to fall. By locking 
noradrenaline synthesis and release with intravenous administration of alpha 
methyl tyrosine, Osterholm demonstrated a marked reduction in the pathology 
found in both grey and white matter. The recovery in the treated animals was 
recorded as significantly improved when compared with the recovery in the 
control group of animals (Osterholm, , ). 
In , Kelly reported significant recovery from induced paraplegia in dogs 
with hyperbaric oxygen (Kelly et al., ). 
Tarlov () stated that irreversible conduction block following compression 
of the spinal cord of the cat was secondary to mechanical deformation and not due 
to hypoxia. 
REVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN SPINAL CORD INJURY 
I. Di Chiro and Wener reviewed the detailed angiographic anatomy which 
is important in the interpretation of the pathology of spinal cord injury. 
Tator and Deecke () demonstrated in monkeys that local perfusion of 
the injured spinal cord with cooled and non-cooled Elliots 'B' solution produced 
significantly better restoration of function than was found in similarly wounded 
non..;perfused animals. They suggested that perfusion dialysis of some noxious 
chemical material from the wounded cord occurred and this thesis would have 
supported much of the work reported by Osterholm. 
Martin and BIodell () evaluated the experimental spinal cord injury 
using cortical evoked potentials. They concluded that bilateral normal sensory­ evoked potentials should indicate functional and probably structural integrity of 
the posterior half of the spinal cord. 
Dohrmann and Wick () documented the fact that the smaller vessels in 
both the central grey and white matter at the level of the injury did not fill, strongly 
suggesting the presence of local retardation or arrested blood flow. 
I. Vise, using fluorescent microscopy with Evans blue as a tracer, reported 
a defective blood-brain barrier in dogs immediately following spinal cord injury. 
Since the pUblication of Osterholm's work in , many other workers have 
been unable to confirm the reported rise of noradrenaline in contused spinal cord 
tissue (Hedeman & Shellenberger, ; Naftchi et at., ; Vise et at., ; 
Hinwood et at., ; Yeo et at., ). 
Until ten years ago little was known of the early dynamic pathological changes 
which occurred in the bruised mammalian spinal cord. As yet, it is still not 
possible to know exactly what happens to the contused human spinal cord and 
information must continue to be obtained from the experimental animal. Isotope 
myelography has been reported as a useful investigation to help identify spinal 
cord swelling and contusion (Yeo & Collins, ). 
This brief historical review summarises many of the studies which are being 
made in animals whose nervous systems closely resemble that of man. The best 
choice for such studies would be the ape, although expensive and difficult to 
nurse satisfactorily for long periods. In this country the sheep has proved an 
adequate experimental model with a suitably sized spinal cord and a satisfactory 
animal for nursing in slings. A detailed assessment of clinical recovery in the 
control and treated animals has been possible and the animals nursed for long 
periods without significant complications (Yeo et at., , , ). 
Much of the basic research work in recent years has been centred on the 
catecholamine release theory with progressive neurological damage in the region 
of the initial spinal cord injury. Drugs such as Alpha methyl tyrosine have been 
found to be highly effective in preventing acute noradrenaline hyperaccumulation 
and when given IS minutes after the injury protect against haemorrhagic necrosis 
in injured spinal cord tissue (Osterholm, ). Why Alpha methyl tyrosine is 
so effective in animal experiments during the acute phases of treatment while 
subacute and chronic injured and treated cords often become severely degenerated 
remains an unanswered question. Hedeman and Shellenberger were unable to 
detect any protection from single treatments of AMT in chronic dog studies 
(Hedeman and Shellenberger, ). Other forms of treatment which have been 
tried in recent years are anti-fibrinolytic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen and anti­ serontonic therapy. The results of these experiments have been summarised in 
an excellent review article by Osterholm (). Many of these physical and 
drug treatments in the experimental animal have been promising but are not yet 
applicable to the paraplegic or quadriplegic patient.
